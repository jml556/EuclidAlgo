Proposition 1.
On a given finite straight line to construct an equilateral triangle.
Let AB be the given finite straight line.
Thus it is required to construct
an equilateral triangle on the straight line AB.

With centre A and distance AB let the circle BCD be described; [Post. 3]
again, with centre B and distance BA let the circle ACE be described; [Post. 3] and from the point C, in which the circles cut one another, to the points A, B let the straight lines CA, CB be joined. [Post. 1]

Now, since the point A is the centre of the circle CDB,

AC is equal to AB. [Def. 15]
Again, since the point B is the centre of the circle CAE,

BC is equal to BA. [Def. 15]
But CA was also proved equal to AB;
therefore each of the straight lines CA, CB is equal to AB.

And things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another; [C.N. 1]

therefore CA is also equal to CB.
Therefore the three straight lines CA, AB, BC are
equal to one another.

Therefore the triangle ABC is equilateral; and it has been constructed on the given finite straight line AB.

(Being) what it was required to do.

Proposition 2.
To place at a given point (as an extremity) a straight line equal to a given straight line.
Let A be the given point, and BC the given straight line.
Thus it is required to place at the point A (as an extremity)
a straight line equal to the given straight line BC.

From the point A to the point B let the straight line AB be joined; [Post. 1] and on it let the equilateral triangle
DAB be constructed. [I. 1]

Let the straight lines AE, BF be produced in a straight line with DA, DB; [Post. 2] with centre B and distance BC let the
circle CGH be described; [Post. 3] and again, with centre D and distance DG let the circle GKL be described. [Post. 3]

Then, since the point B is the centre of the circle CGH,

BC is equal to BG.

Again, since the point D is the centre of the circle GKL,

DL is equal to DG.
And in these DA is equal to DB;

therefore the remainder AL is equal to the remainder BG. [C.N. 3]

But BC was also proved equal to BG;

therefore each of the straight lines AL, BC is equal to BG.
And things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another; [C.N. 1]

therefore AL is also equal to BC.
Therefore at the given point A the straight line AL is placed equal to the given straight line BC.

(Being) what it was required to do.

Proposition 3.
Given two unequal straight lines, to cut off from the greater a straight line equal to the less.
Let AB, C be the-two given unequal straight lines, and let AB be the greater of them.
Thus it is required to cut off from AB the greater a straight line equal to C the less.

At the point A let AD be placed equal to the straight line C; [I. 2] and with centre A and distance AD let the circle DEF be described. [Post. 3]

Now, since the point A is the centre of the circle DEF, AE is equal to AD. [Def. 15] But C is also equal to AD. Therefore each of the straight lines AE, C is equal to AD; so that AE is also equal to C. [C.N. 1]
Therefore, given the two straight lines AB, C, from AB the greater AE has been cut off equal to C the less.

(Being) what it was required to do.
Proposition 4.
If two triangles have the two sides equal to two sides respectively, and have the angles contained by the equal straight lines equal, they will also have the base equal to the base, the triangle will be equal to the triangle, and the remaining angles
will be equal to the remaining angles respectively, namely those which the equal sides subtend.
Let ABC, DEF be two triangles having the two sides AB, AC equal to the two sides DE, DF respectively, namely AB to DE and AC to DF, and the angle BAC equal to the
angle EDF.
I say that the base BC is also equal to the base EF, the triangle ABC will be equal to the triangle DEF, and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles respectively, namely those which the equal sides subtend, that
is, the angle ABC to the angle DEF, and the angle ACB to the angle DFE.

For, if the triangle ABC be applied to the triangle DEF,

and if the point A be placed on the point D and the straight line AB on DE,
then the point B will also coincide with E, because AB is equal to DE.
Again, AB coinciding with DE, the straight line AC will also coincide with DF, because the angle BAC is equal to the angle EDF;

hence the point C will also coincide with the point F, because AC is again equal to DF.

But B also coincided with E; hence the base BC will coincide with the base EF.

[For if, when B coincides with E and C with F, the base BC does not coincide with the base EF, two straight lines will enclose a space: which is impossible.

Therefore the base BC will coincide with EF] and will be equal to it. [C.N. 4]
Thus the whole triangle ABC will coincide with the whole triangle DEF,

and will be equal to it.

And the remaining angles will also coincide with the remaining angles and will be equal to them, the angle ABC to the angle DEF, and the angle ACB to the angle DFE.

Therefore etc.

(Being) what it was required to prove.

Proposition 5.
In isosceles triangles the angles at the base are equal to one another, and, if the equal straight lines be produced further, the angles under the base will be equal to one another.
Let ABC be an isosceles triangle having the side AB
equal to the side AC; and let the straight lines BD, CE be produced further in a straight line with AB, AC. [Post. 2]
I say that the angle ABC is equal to the angle ACB, and the angle CBD to the angle BCE.

Let a point F be taken at random on BD; from AE the greater let AG be cut off equal to AF the less; [I. 3] and let the straight lines FC, GB be joined. [Post. 1]

Then, since AF is equal to AG and AB to AC,

the two sides FA, AC are equal to the two sides GA, AB, respectively;
and they contain a common angle, the angle FAG.
Therefore the base FC is equal to the base GB, and the triangle AFC is equal to the triangle AGB,
and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles respectively, namely those which the equal sides subtend,
that is, the angle ACF to the angle ABG, and the angle AFC to the angle AGB. [I. 4]
And, since the whole AF is equal to the whole AG,

and in these AB is equal to AC, the remainder BF is equal to the remainder CG.
But FC was also proved equal to GB;
therefore the two sides BF, FC are equal to the two sides CG, GB respectively; and the angle BFC is equal to the angle CGB,

while the base BC is common to them;
therefore the triangle BFC is also equal to the triangle CGB,
and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles respectively, namely those which the equal sides subtend;
therefore the angle FBC is equal to the angle GCB, and the angle BCF to the angle CBG.

Accordingly, since the whole angle ABG was proved equal to the angle ACF,

and in these the angle CBG is equal to the angle BCF,
the remaining angle ABC is equal to the remaining angle ACB;
and they are at the base of the triangle ABC.
But the angle FBC was also proved equal to the angle GCB;
and they are under the base.
Therefore etc.

Proposition 6.
If in a triangle two angles be equal to one another, the sides which subtend the equal angles will also be equal to one another.
Let ABC be a triangle having the angle ABC equal to the angle ACB;
I say that the side AB is also equal to the side AC.

For, if AB is unequal to AC, one of them is greater.

Let AB be greater; and from AB the greater let DB be cut off equal to AC the less;

let DC be joined.

Then, since DB is equal to AC, and BC is common,

the two sides DB, BC are equal to the two sides AC, CB respectively;
and the angle DBC is equal to the angle ACB;
therefore the base DC is equal to the base AB, and the triangle DBC will be equal to the triangle ACB, the less to the greater: which is absurd. Therefore AB is not unequal to AC; it is therefore equal to it.
Therefore etc.

Q. E. D.
Proposition 7.
Given two straight lines constructed on a straight line (from its extremities) and meeting in a point, there cannot be constructed on the same straight line (from its extremities), and on the same side of it, two other straight lines meeting in
another point and equal to the former two respectively, namely each to that which has the same extremity with it.
For, if possible, given two straight lines AC, CB constructed on the straight line AB and meeting at the point C, let two other straight lines
AD, DB be constructed on the same straight line AB, on the same side of it, meeting in another point D and equal to the former two respectively, namely each to that which has the same extremity with it, so that CA is
equal to DA which has the same extremity A with it, and CB to DB which has the same extremity B with it; and let CD be joined.
Then, since AC is equal to AD,

the angle ACD is also equal to the angle ADC; [I. 5] therefore the angle ADC is greater than the angle DCB;
therefore the angle CDB is much greater than the angle DCB.
Again, since CB is equal to DB,

the angle CDB is also equal to the angle DCB.

But it was also proved much greater than it:
which is impossible.
Therefore etc.

Q. E. D.

Proposition 8.
If two triangles have the two sides equal to two sides respectively, and have also the base equal to the base, they will also have the angles equal which are contained by the equal straight lines.
Let ABC, DEF be two triangles having the two sides AB, AC equal to the two sides DE, DF respectively, namely AB to DE, and AC to DF; and let them have the base BC equal
to the base EF;
I say that the angle BAC is also equal to the angle EDF.

For, if the triangle ABC be applied to the triangle DEF, and if the point B be placed on
the point E and the straight line BC on EF,

the point C will also coincide with F, because BC is equal to EF.
Then, BC coinciding with EF,

BA, AC will also coincide with ED, DF;

for, if the base BC coincides with the base EF, and the sides BA, AC do not coincide with ED, DF but fall beside them as EG, GF,
then, given two straight lines constructed on a straight line (from its extremities) and meeting in a point, there will have been constructed on the same straight line (from its extremities), and on the same side of it, two other straight lines meeting in another point and equal to the former two respectively, namely each to that which has the same extremity with it. But they cannot be so constructed. [I. 7]
Therefore it is not possible that, if the base BC be applied to the base EF, the sides BA, AC should not coincide with ED, DF;

they will therefore coincide,

so that the angle BAC will also coincide with the angle EDF, and will be equal to it.
If therefore etc.

Proposition 9.
To bisect a given rectilineal angle.
Let the angle BAC be the given rectilineal angle.
Thus it is required to bisect it.

Let a point D be taken at random on AB; let AE be cut off from AC equal to AD; [I. 3] let DE be joined, and on DE let the equilateral triangle DEF be constructed; let AF be joined.

I say that the angle BAC has been bisected by the straight line AF.

For, since AD is equal to AE, and AF is common,

the two sides DA, AF are equal to the two sides EA, AF respectively.
And the base DF is equal to the base EF;

therefore the angle DAF is equal to the angle EAF. [I. 8]
Therefore the given rectilineal angle BAC has been bisected by the straight line AF.

Q. E. F.
Proposition 10.
To bisect a given finite straight line.
Let AB be the given finite straight line.
Thus it is required to bisect the finite straight line AB.

Let the equilateral triangle ABC be constructed on it, [I. 1] and let the angle ACB be bisected by the straight line CD; [I. 9]

I say that the straight line AB has been bisected at the point D.

For, since AC is equal to CB, and CD is common,

the two sides AC, CD are equal to the two sides BC, CD respectively;
and the angle ACD is equal to the angle BCD;
therefore the base AD is equal to the base BD. [I. 4]
Therefore the given finite straight line AB has been bisected at D.

Q. E. F.
Proposition 11.
To draw a straight line at right angles to a given straight line from a given point on it.
Let AB be the given straight line, and C the given point on it.
Thus it is required to draw from the point C a straight line at right angles to the straight line AB.

Let a point D be taken at random on AC;
let CE be made equal to CD; [I. 3] on DE let the equilateral triangle FDE be constructed, [I. 1] and let FC be joined;

I say that the straight line FC has been drawn at right
angles to the given straight line AB from C the given point on it.

For, since DC is equal to CE, and CF is common,

the two sides DC, CF are equal to the two sides EC, CF respectively;
and the base DF is equal to the base FE;
therefore the angle DCF is equal to the angle ECF; [I. 8]
and they are adjacent angles.
But, when a straight line set up on a straight line makes
the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal angles is right; [Def. 10]

therefore each of the angles DCF, FCE is right.
Therefore the straight line CF has been drawn at right angles to the given straight line AB from the given point
C on it.

Q. E. F.

Proposition 12.
To a given infinite straight line, from a given point which is not on it, to draw a perpendicular straight line.
Let AB be the given infinite straight line, and C the given point which is not on it;
thus it is required to draw to the given infinite straight line AB, from the given point C which is not on it, a perpendicular straight line.
For let a point D be taken
at random on the other side of the straight line AB, and with centre C and distance CD let the circle EFG be described; [Post. 3]

let the straight line EG be bisected at H, [I. 10] and let the straight lines CG, CH, CE be joined. [Post. 1]
I say that CH has been drawn perpendicular to the given infinite straight line AB from the given point C which is not on it.

For, since GH is equal to HE, and HC is common,

the two sides GH, HC are equal to the two sides EH, HC respectively;
and the base CG is equal to the base CE;
therefore the angle CHG is equal to the angle EHC. [I. 8] And they are adjacent angles.
But, when a straight line set up on a straight line makes the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal angles is right, and the straight line standing on the other is
called a perpendicular to that on which it stands. [Def. 10]

Therefore CH has been drawn perpendicular to the given infinite straight line AB from the given point C which is not on it.

Q. E. F.

Proposition 13.
If a straight line set up on a straight line make angles, it will make either two right angles or angles equal to two right angles.
For let any straight line AB set up on the straight line
CD make the angles CBA, ABD;
I say that the angles CBA, ABD are either two right angles or equal to two right angles.

Now, if the angle CBA is equal to
the angle ABD,

they are two right angles. [Def. 10]
But, if not, let BE be drawn from the point B at right angles to CD; [I. 11]

therefore the angles CBE, EBD are two right angles.

Then, since the angle CBE is equal to the two angles CBA, ABE,

let the angle EBD be added to each; therefore the angles CBE, EBD are equal to the three angles CBA, ABE, EBD. [C. N. 2]

Again, since the angle DBA is equal to the two angles DBE, EBA,

let the angle ABC be added to each; therefore the angles DBA. ABC are equal to the three angles DBE, EBA, ABC. [C. N. 2]

But the angles CBE, EBD were also proved equal to the same three angles;

and things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another; [C. N. 1] therefore the angles CBE, EBD are also equal to the angles DBA, ABC.
But the angles CBE, EBD are two right angles;
therefore the angles DBA, ABC are also equal to two right angles.
Therefore etc.

Q. E. D.

Proposition 14.
If with any straight line, and at a point on it, two straight lines not lying on the same side make the adjacent angles equal to two right angles, the two straight lines will be in a straight line with one another.
For with any straight line AB, and at the point B on it, let the two straight lines BC, BD not lying on the same side make the adjacent angles ABC, ABD equal to two right angles;
I say that BD is in a straight line with CB.

For, if BD is not in a straight line with BC, let BE be in a straight line with CB.

Then, since the straight line AB stands on the straight line CBE,

the angles ABC, ABE are equal to two right angles. [I. 13]
But the angles ABC, ABD are also equal to two right angles;
therefore the angles CBA, ABE are equal to the angles CBA, ABD. [Post. 4 and C.N. 1]
Let the angle CBA be subtracted from each;
therefore the remaining angle ABE is equal to the remaining angle ABD, [C.N. 3]

the less to the greater: which is impossible. Therefore BE is not in a straight line with CB.
Similarly we can prove that neither is any other straight
line except BD.

Therefore CB is in a straight line with BD.
Therefore etc.

Proposition 15.
If two straight lines cut one another, they make the vertical angles equal to one another.
For let the straight lines AB, CD cut one another at the point E;
I say that the angle AEC is equal to the angle DEB,

and the angle CEB to the angle AED.
For, since the straight line AE stands
on the straight line CD, making the angles CEA, AED,

the angles CEA, AED are equal to two right angles [I. 13]
Again, since the straight line DE stands on the straight line AB, making the angles AED, DEB,

the angles AED, DEB are equal to two right angles. [I. 13]

But the angles CEA, AED were also proved equal to two right angles;

therefore the angles CEA, AED are equal to the angles AED DEB. [Post. 4 and C. N. 1] Let the angle AED be subtracted from each; therefore the remaining angle CEA is equal to the remaining angle BED. [C. N. 3]
Similarly it can be proved that the angles CEB, DEA are also equal.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

Porism.
[From this it is manifest that, if two straight lines cut one another, they will make the angles at the point of section equal to four right angles.

Proposition 16.
In any triangle, if one of the sides be produced, the exterior angle is greater than either of the interior and opposite angles.
Let ABC be a triangle, and let one side of it BC be produced to D;
I say that the exterior angle ACD is greater than either of the interior and opposite angles CBA, BAC.

Let AC be bisected at E [I. 10], and let BE be joined and produced
in a straight line to F;

let EF be made equal to BE[I. 3], let FC be joined [Post. 1], and let AC be drawn through to G [Post. 2].

Then, since AE is equal to EC,
and BE to EF,

the two sides AE, EB are equal to the two sides CE, EF respectively; and the angle AEB is equal to the angle FEC, for they are vertical angles. [I. 15] Therefore the base AB is equal to the base FC, and the triangle ABE is equal to the triangle CFE, and the remaining angles are equal to the remaining angles respectively, namely those which the equal sides subtend; [I. 4] therefore the angle BAE is equal to the angle ECF.

But the angle ECD is greater than the angle ECF; [C. N. 5]

therefore the angle ACD is greater than the angle BAE.
Similarly also, if BC be bisected, the angle BCG, that is, the angle ACD [I. 15], can be proved greater than the angle ABC as well.

Therefore etc.

Proposition 17.
In any triangle two angles taken together in any manner are less than two right angles.
Let ABC be a triangle; I say that two angles of the triangle ABC taken together in any manner are less than two right angles.
For let BC be produced to D. [Post. 2]

Then, since the angle ACD is an exterior angle of the triangle ABC,

it is greater than the interior and opposite angle ABC. [I. 16]

Let the angle ACB be added to each;
therefore the angles ACD, ACB are greater than the angles ABC, BCA. But the angles ACD, ACB are equal to two right angles. [I. 13]
Therefore the angles ABC, BCA are less than two right angles.

Similarly we can prove that the angles BAC, ACB are also less than two right angles, and so are the angles CAB, ABC as well.

Therefore etc.

Q. E. D.

Proposition 18.
In any triangle the greater side subtends the greater angle.
For let ABC be a triangle having the side AC greater than AB;
I say that the angle ABC is also greater than the angle BCA.

For, since AC is greater than AB, let AD be made equal to AB [I. 3], and let BD bejoined.

Then, since the angle ADB is an exterior angle of the triangle BCD,

it is greater than the interior and opposite angle DCB. [I. 16]

But the angle ADB is equal to the angle ABD,

since the side AB is equal to AD; therefore the angle ABD is also greater than the angle ACB; therefore the angle ABC is much greater than the angle ACB.
Therefore etc.

Q. E. D.

Proposition 19.
In any triangle the greater angle is subtended by the greater side.
Let ABC be a triangle having the angle ABC greater than the angle BCA;
I say that the side AC is also greater than the side AB.

For, if not, AC is either equal to AB or less.

Now AC is not equal to AB; for then the angle ABC would also have been equal to the angle ACB; [I. 5] but it is not;

therefore AC is not equal to AB.
Neither is AC less than AB, for then the angle ABC would also have been less than the angle ACB; [I. 18] but it is not;

therefore AC is not less than AB.
And it was proved that it is not equal either.

Therefore AC is greater than AB.
Therefore etc.

Q. E. D.
Proposition 20.
In any triangle two sides taken together in any manner are greater than the remaining one.
For let ABC be a triangle; I say that in the triangle ABC two sides taken together in any manner are greater than the remaining one, namely
BA, AC greater than BC, AB, BC greater than AC, BC, CA greater than AB.
For let BA be drawn through to the point D, let DA be made equal to CA, and let DC be joined.

Then, since DA is equal to AC, the angle ADC is also equal to the angle ACD; [I. 5]

therefore the angle BCD is greater than the angle ADC. [C.N. 5]
And, since DCB is a triangle having the angle BCD greater than the angle BDC,

and the greater angle is subtended by the greater side, [I. 19] therefore DB is greater than BC.
But DA is equal to AC;

therefore BA, AC are greater than BC.
Similarly we can prove that AB, BC are also greater than CA, and BC, CA than AB.

Therefore etc.

Q. E. D.

Proposition 21.
If on one of the sides of a triangle, from its extremities, there be constructed two straight lines meeting within the triangle, the straight lines so constructed will be less than the remaining two sides of the triangle, but will contain a greater
angle.
On BC, one of the sides of the triangle ABC, from its extremities B, C, let the two straight lines BD, DC be constructed meeting within the triangle;
I say that BD, DC are less than the remaining two sides
of the triangle BA, AC, but contain an angle BDC greater than the angle BAC.

For let BD be drawn through to E.

Then, since in any triangle two sides are greater than the remaining
one, [I. 20]

therefore, in the triangle ABE, the two sides AB, AE are greater than BE.
Let EC be added to each;

therefore BA, AC are greater than BE, EC.

Again, since, in the triangle CED,

the two sides CE, ED are greater than CD, let DB be added to each; therefore CE, EB are greater than CD, DB.
But BA, AC were proved greater than BE, EC;

therefore BA, AC are much greater than BD, DC.
Again, since in any triangle the exterior angle is greater than the interior and opposite angle, [I. 16] therefore, in the triangle CDE,

the exterior angle BDC is greater than the angle CED.

For the same reason, moreover, in the triangle ABE also,

the exterior angle CEB is greater than the angle BAC.
But the angle BDC was proved greater than the angle CEB;
therefore the angle BDC is much greater than the angle BAC.

Therefore etc.

Q. E. D.

Proposition 22.
Out of three straight lines, which are equal to three given straight lines, to construct a triangle: thus it is necessary that two of the straight lines taken together in any manner should be greater than the remaining one. [I. 20]
Let the three given straight lines be A, B, C, and of these let two taken together in any manner be greater than the remaining one, namely A, B greater than C,
A, C greater than B,
and B, C greater than A; thus it is required to construct a triangle out of straight lines equal to A, B, C.
Let there be set out a straight line DE, terminated at D but of infinite length in the direction of E, and let DF be made equal to A, FG equal to B, and GH equal to C. [I. 3]

With centre F and distance FD let the circle DKL be described; again, with centre G and distance GH let the circle KLH be described; and let KF, KG be joined;

I say that the triangle KFG has been constructed out of three straight lines equal to A, B, C.

For, since the point F is the centre of the circle DKL,

FD is equal to FK.
But FD is equal to A;

therefore KF is also equal to A.
Again, since the point G is the centre of the circle LKH,

GH is equal to GK.
But GH is equal to C;

therefore KG is also equal to C. And FG is also equal to B;
therefore the three straight lines KF, FG, GK are equal to the three straight lines A, B, C.
Therefore out of the three straight lines KF, FG, GK, which are equal to the three given straight lines A, B, C, the triangle KFG has been constructed.

Proposition 23.
On a given straight line and at a point on it to construct a rectilineal angle equal to a given rectilineal angle.
Let AB be the given straight line, A the point on it, and the angle DCE the given rectilineal angle;
thus it is required to construct on the given straight line AB, and at the point A on it, a rectilineal angle equal to the given rectilineal angle DCE.

On the straight lines CD, CE respectively let the points D, E be taken at random; let DE be joined, and out of three straight lines which are equal to the three straight lines CD, DE, CE let the triangle AFG be constructed in such a way that CD is equal to AF, CE to AG, and further DE to FG.

Then, since the two sides DC, CE are equal to the two sides FA, AG respectively,

and the base DE is equal to the base FG, the angle DCE is equal to the angle FAG. [I. 8]
Therefore on the given straight line AB, and at the point A on it, the rectilineal angle FAG has been constructed equal to the given rectilineal angle DCE.

Q. E. F.
Proposition 24.
If two triangles have the two sides equal to two sides respectively, but have the one of the angles contained by the equal straight lines greater than the other, they will also have the base greater than the base.
Let ABC, DEF be two triangles having the two sides AB, AC equal to the two sides DE, DF respectively, namely AB to DE, and AC to DF, and let the angle at A be greater than the angle at D;
I say that the base BC is also greater than the base EF.

For, since the angle BAC is greater than the angle EDF, let there be constructed, on the straight line DE, and at the point D on it, the angle EDG
equal to the angle BAC; [I. 23] let DG be made equal to either of the two straight lines AC, DF, and let EG, FG be joined.

Then, since AB is equal to DE, and AC to DG,
the two sides BA, AC are equal to the two sides ED, DG, respectively;

and the angle BAC is equal to the angle EDG; therefore the base BC is equal to the base EG. [I. 4]
Again, since DF is equal to DG,

the angle DGF is also equal to the angle DFG; [I. 5] therefore the angle DFG is greater than the angle EGF.
Therefore the angle EFG is much greater than the angle EGF.

And, since EFG is a triangle having the angle EFG
greater than the angle EGF,

and the greater angle is subtended by the greater side, [I. 19] the side EG is also greater than EF.
But EG is equal to BC.

Therefore BC is also greater than EF.

Therefore etc.

Q. E. D.

Proposition 25.
If two triangles have the two sides equal to two sides respectively, but have the base greater than the base, they will also have the one of the angles contained by the equal straight lines greater than the other.
Let ABC, DEF be two triangles having the two sides AB, AC equal to the two sides DE, DF respectively, namely AB to DE, and AC to DF; and let the base BC be greater than the base EF;
I say that the angle BAC is also greater than the angle EDF.

For, if not, it is either equal to it or less.

Now the angle BAC is not equal to the angle EDF; for then the base BC would also have been equal to the base EF, [I. 4]

but it is not; therefore the angle BAC is not equal to the angle EDF.
Neither again is the angle BAC less than the angle EDF; for then the base BC would also have been less than the base EF, [I. 24]

but it is not; therefore the angle BAC is not less than the angle EDF.
But it was proved that it is not equal either;

therefore the angle BAC is greater than the angle EDF.
Therefore etc.

Proposition 26.
If two triangles have the two angles equal to two angles respectively, and one side equal to one side, namely, either the side adjoining the equal angles, or that subtending one of the equal angles, they will also have the remaining sides equal to
the remaining sides and the remaining angle to the remaining angle.
Let ABC, DEF be two triangles having the two angles ABC, BCA equal to the two angles DEF, EFD respectively, namely the angle ABC to the angle DEF, and the angle
BCA to the angle EFD; and let them also have one side equal to one side, first that adjoining the equal angles, namely BC to EF;
I say that they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides respectively, namely AB to DE and
AC to DF, and the remaining angle to the remaining angle, namely the angle BAC to the angle EDF.

For, if AB is unequal to DE, one of them is greater.

Let AB be greater, and let BG be made equal to DE; and let GC be joined.

Then, since BG is equal to DE, and BC to EF, the two sides GB, BC are equal to the two sides DE, EF respectively; and the angle GBC is equal to the angle DEF;

therefore the base GC is equal to the base DF, and the triangle GBC is equal to the triangle DEF, and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles, namely those which the equal sides subtend; [I. 4] therefore the angle GCB is equal to the angle DFE.
But the angle DFE is by hypothesis equal to the angle BCA;
therefore the angle BCG is equal to the angle BCA, the less to the greater: which is impossible. Therefore AB is not unequal to DE, and is therefore equal to it.
But BC is also equal to EF;

therefore the two sides AB, BC are equal to the two sides DE, EF respectively, and the angle ABC is equal to the angle DEF; therefore the base AC is equal to the base DF, and the remaining angle BAC is equal to the remaining angle EDF. [I. 4]
Again, let sides subtending equal angles be equal, as AB to DE;

I say again that the remaining sides will be equal to the remaining sides, namely AC to DF and BC to EF, and
further the remaining angle BAC is equal to the remaining angle EDF.

For, if BC is unequal to EF, one of them is greater.

Let BC be greater, if possible, and let BH be made equal to EF; let AH be joined.

Then, since BH is equal to EF, and AB to DE, the two sides AB, BH are equal to the two sides DE, EF respectively, and they contain equal angles;

therefore the base AH is equal to the base DF,
and the triangle ABH is equal to the triangle DEF,
and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles, namely those which the equal sides subtend; [I. 4]
therefore the angle BHA is equal to the angle EFD.
But the angle EFD is equal to the angle BCA; therefore, in the triangle AHC, the exterior angle BHA is
equal to the interior and opposite angle BCA:

which is impossible. [I. 16]
Therefore BC is not unequal to EF,

and is therefore equal to it.
But AB is also equal to DE;
therefore the two sides AB, BC are equal to the two sides DE, EF respectively, and they contain equal angles;

therefore the base AC is equal to the base DF, the triangle ABC equal to the triangle DEF,
and the remaining angle BAC equal to the remaining angle
EDF. [I. 4]
Therefore etc.

Proposition 27.
If a straight line falling on two straight lines make the alternate angles equal to one another, the straight lines will be parallel to one another.
For let the straight line EF falling on the two straight
lines AB, CD make the alternate angles AEF, EFD equal to one another;
I say that AB is parallel to CD.

For, if not, AB, CD when produced will meet either in the direction
of B, D or towards A, C.

Let them be produced and meet, in the direction of B, D, at G.

Then, in the triangle GEF, the exterior angle AEF is equal to the interior and opposite
angle EFG: which is impossible. [I. 16]

Therefore AB, CD when produced will not meet in the direction of B, D.

Similarly it can be proved that neither will they meet
towards A, C.

But straight lines which do not meet in either direction are parallel; [Def. 23]

therefore AB is parallel to CD.
Therefore etc.

Proposition 28.
If a straight line falling on two straight lines make the exterior angle equal to the interior and opposite angle on the same side, or the interior angles on the same side equal to two right angles, the straight lines will be parallel to one another.
For let the straight line EF falling on the two straight lines AB, CD make the exterior angle EGB equal to the interior and opposite angle GHD, or the interior angles on the same side, namely BGH, GHD, equal to two right angles;
I say that AB is parallel to CD.

For, since the angle EGB is equal to the angle GHD, while the angle EGB is equal to the angle AGH, [I. 15] the angle AGH is also equal to the angle GHD; and they are alternate;

therefore AB is parallel to CD. [I. 27]
Again, since the angles BGH, GHD are equal to two right angles, and the angles AGH, BGH are also equal to two right angles, [I. 13] the angles AGH, BGH are equal to the angles BGH, GHD.

Let the angle BGH be subtracted from each; therefore the remaining angle AGH is equal to the remaining angle GHD; and they are alternate;

therefore AB is parallel to CD. [I. 27]
Therefore etc.

Q. E. D.
Proposition 29.
A straight line falling on parallel straight lines makes the alternate angles equal to one another, the exterior angle equal to the interior and opposite angle, and the interior angles on the same side equal to two right angles.
For let the straight line EF fall on the parallel straight lines AB, CD;
I say that it makes the alternate angles AGH, GHD equal, the exterior angle EGB equal to the interior and opposite angle GHD, and the interior angles on the same
side, namely BGH, GHD, equal to two right angles.

For, if the angle AGH is unequal to the angle GHD, one of them is greater.

Let the angle AGH be greater.

Let the angle BGH be added to each; therefore the angles AGH, BGH are greater than the angles BGH, GHD.

But the angles AGH, BGH are equal to two right angles; [I. 13]

therefore the angles BGH, GHD are less than two right angles.
But straight lines produced indefinitely from angles less than two right angles meet; [Post. 5]

therefore AB, CD, if produced indefinitely, will meet; but they do not meet, because they are by hypothesis parallel.
Therefore the angle AGH is not unequal to the angle GHD,

and is therefore equal to it.

Again, the angle AGH is equal to the angle EGB; [I. 15]

therefore the angle EGB is also equal to the angle GHD. [C.N. 1]
Let the angle BGH be added to each;

therefore the angles EGB, BGH are equal to the angles BGH, GHD. [C.N. 2]
But the angles EGB, BGH are equal to two right angles; [I. 13]

therefore the angles BGH, GHD are also equal to two right angles.
Therefore etc.

Proposition 30.
Straight lines parallel to the same straight line are also parallel to one another.
Let each of the straight lines AB, CD be parallel to EF; I say that AB is also parallel to CD.
For let the straight line GK fall upon them;

Then, since the straight line GK has fallen on the parallel straight lines AB, EF,

the angle AGK is equal to the angle GHF. [I. 29]
Again, since the straight line GK has fallen on the parallel straight lines EF, CD,

the angle GHF is equal to the angle GKD. [I. 29]

But the angle AGK was also proved equal to the angle GHF;

therefore the angle AGK is also equal to the angle GKD; [C.N. 1]
and they are alternate.
Therefore AB is parallel to CD.

Proposition 31.
Through a given point to draw a straight line parallel to a given straight line.
Let A be the given point, and BC the given straight line; thus it is required to draw through the point A a straight line parallel to the straight line BC.
Let a point D be taken at random on BC, and let AD be joined; on the straight line DA, and at the point A on it, let the angle DAE be constructed equal to the angle ADC [I. 23]; and let the straight line AF be produced in a straight line with EA.

Then, since the straight line AD falling on the two straight lines BC, EF has made the alternate angles EAD, ADC equal to one another,

therefore EAF is parallel to BC. [I. 27]
Therefore through the given point A the straight line EAF has been drawn parallel to the given straight line BC.

Q. E. F.
Proposition 32.
In any triangle, if one of the sides be produced, the exterior angle is equal to the two interior and opposite angles, and the three interior angles of the triangle are equal to two right angles.
Let ABC be a triangle, and let one side of it BC be produced to D;
I say that the exterior angle ACD is equal to the two interior and opposite angles CAB, ABC, and the three interior angles of the triangle ABC, BCA, CAB are equal to two right angles.

For let CE be drawn through the point C parallel to the straight line AB. [I. 31]

Then, since AB is parallel to CE,

and AC has fallen upon them, the alternate angles BAC, ACE are equal to one another. [I. 29]
Again, since AB is parallel to CE,

and the straight line BD has fallen upon them,
the exterior angle ECD is equal to the interior and opposite angle ABC. [I. 29]
But the angle ACE was also proved equal to the angle BAC;

therefore the whole angle ACD is equal to the two interior and opposite angles BAC, ABC.
Let the angle ACB be added to each;

therefore the angles ACD, ACB are equal to the three angles ABC, BCA, CAB.
But the angles ACD, ACB are equal to two right angles; [I. 13]

therefore the angles ABC, BCA, CAB are also equal to two right angles.
Therefore etc.

Q. E. D.
Proposition 33.
The straight lines joining equal and parallel straight lines (at the extremities which are) in the same directions (respectively) are themselves also equal and parallel.
Let AB, CD be equal and parallel, and let the straight
lines AC, BD join them (at the extremities which are) in the same directions (respectively); I say that AC, BD are also equal and parallel.
Let BC be joined.

Then, since AB is parallel to CD,
and BC has fallen upon them,

the alternate angles ABC, BCD are equal to one another. [I. 29]
And, since AB is equal to CD,

and BC is common, the two sides AB, BC are equal to the two sides DC, CB; and the angle ABC is equal to the angle BCD; therefore the base AC is equal to the base BD, and the griangle ABC is equal to the triangle DCB, and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles respectively, namely those which the equal sides subtend; [I. 4] therefore the angle ACB is equal to the angle CBD.
And, since the straight line BC falling on the two straight lines AC, BD has made the alternate angles equal to one another,

AC is parallel to BD. [I. 27]
And it was also proved equal to it.

Therefore etc.

Proposition 34.
In parallelogrammic areas the opposite sides and angles are equal to one another, and the diameter bisects the areas.
Let ACDB be a parallelogrammic area, and BC its diameter;
I say that the opposite sides and angles of the parallelogram ACDB are equal to one another, and the diameter BC bisects it.
For, since AB is parallel to CD, and the straight line BC has fallen
upon them,

the alternate angles ABC, BCD are equal to one another. [I. 29]
Again, since AC is parallel to BD, and BChas fallen upon them,

the alternate angles ACB, CBD are equal to one another. [I. 29]
Therefore ABC, DCB are two triangles having the two angles ABC, BCA equal to the two angles DCB, CBD respectively, and one side equal to one side, namely that
adjoining the equal angles and common to both of them, BC;

therefore they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides respectively, and the remaining angle to the remaining angle; [I. 26] therefore the side AB is equal to CD, and AC to BD,
and further the angle BAC is equal to the angle CDB.
And, since the angle ABC is equal to the angle BCD,

and the angle CBD to the angle ACB, the whole angle ABD is equal to the whole angle ACD. [C.N. 2]

And the angle BAC was also proved equal to the angle CDB.
Therefore in parallelogrammic areas the opposite sides and angles are equal to one another.

I say, next, that the diameter also bisects the areas.

For, since AB is equal to CD,
and BC is common, the two sides AB, BC are equal to the two sides DC, CB respectively;

and the angle ABC is equal to the angle BCD; therefore the base AC is also equal to DB, and the triangle ABC is equal to the triangle DCB. [I. 4]
Therefore the diameter BC bisects the parallelogram ACDB.

Proposition 35.
Parallelograms which are on the same base and in the same parallels are equal to one another.
Let ABCD, EBCF be parallelograms on the same base BC and in the same parallels AF, BC;
I say that ABCD is equal to the parallelogram EBCF.
For, since ABCD is a parallelogram,

AD is equal to BC. [I. 34]
For the same reason also

EF is equal to BC, so that AD is also equal to EF; [C.N. 1]
and DE is common;
therefore the whole AE is equal to the whole DF. [C.N. 2]
But AB is also equal to DC; [I. 34] therefore the two sides EA, AB are equal to the two sides
FD, DC respectively,

and the angle FDC is equal to the angle EAB, the exterior to the interior; [I. 29] therefore the base EB is equal to the base FC, and the triangle EAB will be equal to the triangle FDC. [I. 4]
Let DGE be subtracted from each; therefore the trapezium ABGD which remains is equal to the trapezium EGCF which remains. [C.N. 3]

Let the triangle GBC be added to each; therefore the whole parallelogram ABCD is equal to the whole parallelogram EBCF. [C.N. 2]

Parallelograms which are on equal bases and in the same parallels are equal to one another.
Let ABCD, EFGH be parallelograms which are on equal bases BC, FG and in the same parallels AH, BG; I say that the parallelogram ABCD is equal to EFGH.
For let BE, CH be joined.

Then, since BC is equal to FG while FG is equal to EH,

BC is also equal to EH. [C.N. 1]
But they are also parallel.

And EB, HC join them; but straight lines joining equal and parallel straight lines (at the extremities which are) in the same directions (respectively) are equal and parallel. [I. 33]

Therefore EBCH is a parallelogram. [I. 34]

And it is equal to ABCD; for it has the same base BC with it, and is in the same parallels BC, AH with it. [I. 35]

For the same reason also EFGH is equal to the same EBCH; [I. 35] so that the parallelogram ABCD is also equal to EFGH. [C.N. 1]

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

Triangles which are on the same base and in the same parallels are equal to one another.
Let ABC, DBC be triangles on the same base BC and in the same parallels AD, BC;

Let AD be produced in both directions to E, F; through B let BE be drawn parallel to CA, [I. 31]
and through C let CF be drawn parallel to BD. [I. 31]

Then each of the figures EBCA, DBCF is a parallelogram; and they are equal,

for they are on the same base BC and in the same parallels BC, EF. [I. 35]

Moreover the triangle ABC is half of the parallelogram EBCA; for the diameter AB bisects it. [I. 34]

And the triangle DBC is half of the parallelogram DBCF;
for the diameter DC bisects it. [I. 34]

[But the halves of equal things are equal to one another.]

Therefore the triangle ABC is equal to the triangle DBC.

Therefore etc.

Triangles which are on equal bases and in the same parallels are equal to one another.
Let ABC, DEF be triangles on equal bases BC, EF and in the same parallels BF, AD; I say that the triangle ABC is equal to the triangle DEF.
For let AD be produced in both directions to G, H; through B let BG be drawn parallel to CA, [I. 31] and through F let FH be drawn parallel to DE.

Then each of the figures GBCA, DEFH is a parallelogram; and GBCA is equal to DEFH;

for they are on equal bases BC, EF and in the same parallels BF, GH. [I. 36]

Moreover the triangle ABC is half of the parallelogram GBCA; for the diameter AB bisects it. [I. 34]

And the triangle FED is half of the parallelogram DEFH; for the diameter DF bisects it. [I. 34]

[But the halves of equal things are equal to one another.]

Therefore the triangle ABC is equal to the triangle DEF.

Therefore etc.

Proposition 39.
Equal triangles which are on the same base and on the same side are also in the same parallels.
Let ABC, DBC be equal triangles which are on the same base BC and on the same side of it;

And [For] let AD be joined; I say that AD is parallel to BC.

For, if not, let AE be drawn through the point A parallel to the straight line
BC, [I. 31] and let EC be joined.

Therefore the triangle ABC is equal to the triangle EBC; for it is on the same base BC with it and in the same
parallels. [I. 37]

But ABC is equal to DBC;

therefore DBC is also equal to EBC, [C.N. 1] the greater to the less: which is impossible.
Therefore AE is not parallel to BC.

Similarly we can prove that neither is any other straight line except AD;

therefore AD is parallel to BC.

Equal triangles which are on equal bases and on the same side are also in the same parallels.

For let AD be joined; I say that AD is parallel to BE.

For, if not, let AF be drawn through A parallel to BE [I. 31], and let FE be joined.

Therefore the triangle ABC is equal to the triangle FCE; for they are on equal bases BC, CE and in the same parallels BE, AF. [I. 38]

But the triangle ABC is equal to the triangle DCE;

therefore the triangle DCE is also equal to the triangle FCE, [C.N. 1] the greater to the less: which is impossible. Therefore AF is not parallel to BE.
Similarly we can prove that neither is any other straight line except AD;

therefore AD is parallel to BE.

Proposition 41.
If a parallelogram have the same base with a triangle and be in the same parallels, the parallelogram is double of the triangle.
For let the parallelogram ABCD have the same base BC with the triangle EBC, and let it be in the same parallels BC, AE;
I say that the parallelogram ABCD is double of the triangle BEC.

For let AC be joined.

Then the triangle ABC is equal to the triangle EBC; for it is on the same base BC with it and in the same parallels BC, AE. [I. 37]

But the parallelogram ABCD is double of the triangle ABC;

for the diameter AC bisects it; [I. 34]
so that the parallelogram ABCD is also double of the triangle EBC.
Therefore etc.

Q. E. D.
Proposition 42.
To construct, in a given rectilineal angle, a parallelogram equal to a given triangle.
Let ABC be the given triangle, and D the given rectilineal angle; thus it is required to construct in the rectilineal angle D a parallelogram equal to the triangle ABC.
Let BC be bisected at E, and let AE be joined; on the straight line EC, and at the point E on it, let the angle CEF be constructed equal to the angle D; [I. 23] through A let AG be drawn parallel to EC, and [I. 31] through C let CG be drawn parallel to EF.

Then FECG is a parallelogram.

And, since BE is equal to EC,

the triangle ABE is also equal to the triangle AEC, for they are on equal bases BE, EC and in the same parallels BC, AG; [I. 38] therefore the triangle ABC is double of the triangle AEC.
But the parallelogram FECG is also double of the triangle AEC, for it has the same base with it and is in the same parallels with it; [I. 41]

therefore the parallelogram FECG is equal to the triangle ABC.
And it has the angle CEF equal to the given angle D.

Therefore the parallelogram FECG has been constructed equal to the given triangle ABC, in the angle CEF which is equal to D. Q. E. F.

Proposition 43.
In any parallelogram the complements of the parallelograms about the diameter are equal to one another.
Let ABCD be a parallelogram, and AC its diameter; and about AC let EH, FG be parallelograms, and BK, KD
the so-called complements;
I say that the complement BK is equal to the complement KD.

For, since ABCD is a parallelogram, and AC its diameter,

the triangle ABC is equal to the triangle ACD. [I. 34]
Again, since EH is a parallelogram, and AK is its diameter,

the triangle AEK is equal to the triangle AHK.

For the same reason
the triangle KFC is also equal to KGC.
Now, since the triangle AEK is equal to the triangle AHK,

and KFC to KGC,

the triangle AEK together with KGC is equal to the triangle AHK together with KFC. [C.N. 2]
And the whole triangle ABC is also equal to the whole ADC; therefore the complement BK which remains is equal to the
complement KD which remains. [C.N. 3]

Proposition 44.
To a given straight line to apply, in a given rectilineal angle, a parallelogram equal to a given triangle.
Let AB be the given straight line, C the given triangle and D the given rectilineal angle;
thus it is required to apply to the given straight line AB, in an angle equal to the angle D, a parallelogram equal to the given triangle C.
Let the parallelogram BEFG be constructed equal to the triangle C, in the angle EBG which is equal to D [I. 42];
let it be placed so that BE is in a straight line with AB; letFG be drawn through to H, and let AH be drawn through A parallel to either BG or EF. [I. 31]

Let HB be joined.

Then, since the straight line HF falls upon the parallels
AH, EF,

the angles AHF, HFE are equal to two right angles. [I. 29]
Therefore the angles BHG, GFE are less than two right angles; and straight lines produced indefinitely from angles less than
two right angles meet; [Post. 5]
therefore HB, FE, when produced, will meet.
Let them be produced and meet at K; through the point K let KL be drawn parallel to either EA or FH, [I. 31] and let HA, GB be produced to the points L, M.

Then HLKF is a parallelogram, HK is its diameter, and AG, ME are parallelograms. and LB, BF the so-called complements, about HK;

therefore LB is equal to BF. [I. 43]
But BF is equal to the triangle C;

therefore LB is also equal to C. [C.N. 1]
And, since the angle GBE is equal to the angle ABM, [I. 15]

while the angle GBE is equal to D, the angle ABM is also equal to the angle D.
Therefore the parallelogram LB equal to the given triangle
C has been applied to the given straight line AB, in the angle ABM which is equal to D.

Proposition 45.
To construct, in a given rectilineal angle, a parallelogram equal to a given rectilineal figure.
Let ABCD be the given rectilineal figure and E the given rectilineal angle;
thus it is required to construct, in the given angle E, a parallelogram equal to the rectilineal figure ABCD.
Let DB be joined, and let the parallelogram FH be constructed equal to the triangle ABD, in the angle HKF which is equal to E; [I. 42]
let the parallelogram GM equal to the triangle DBC be applied to the straight line GH, in the angle GHM which is equal to E. [I. 44]

Then, since the angle E is equal to each of the angles HKF, GHM,

the angle HKF is also equal to the angle GHM. [C.N. 1]
Let the angle KHG be added to each; therefore the angles FKH, KHG are equal to the angles KHG, GHM.

But the angles FKH, KHG are equal to two right angles; [I. 29]
therefore the angles KHG, GHM are also equal to two right angles.

Thus, with a straight line GH, and at the point H on it, two straight lines KH, HM not lying on the same side make the adjacent angles equal to two right angles;

therefore KH is in a straight line with HM. [I. 14]
And, since the straight line HG falls upon the parallels KM, FG, the alternate angles MHG, HGF are equal to one another. [I. 29]

Let the angle HGL be added to each;
therefore the angles MHG, HGL are equal to the angles HGF, HGL. [C.N. 2]

But the angles MHG, HGL are equal to two right angles; [I. 29] therefore the angles HGF, HGL are also equal to two right angles. [C.N. 1]

Therefore FG is in a straight line with GL. [I. 14]
And, since FK is equal and parallel to HG, [I. 34]

and HG to ML also,
KF is also equal and parallel to ML; [C.N. 1; I. 30] and the straight lines KM, FL join them (at their extremities);
therefore KM, FL are also equal and parallel. [I. 33]
Therefore KFLM is a parallelogram.
And, since the triangle ABD is equal to the parallelogram FH,

and DBC to GM,

the whole rectilineal figure ABCD is equal to the whole parallelogram KFLM.
Therefore the parallelogram KFLM has been constructed equal to the given rectilineal figure ABCD, in the angle FKM which is equal to the given angle E.

Proposition 46.
On a given straight line to describe a square.
Let AB be the given straight line; thus it is required to describe a square on the straight line AB.
Let AC be drawn at right angles to the straight line AB from the point A on it [I. 11], and let AD be made equal to AB; through the point D let DE be drawn
parallel to AB, and through the point B let BE be drawn parallel to AD. [I. 31]

Therefore ADEB is a parallelogram;

therefore AB is equal to DE, and AD to BE. [I. 34]
But AB is equal to AD;

therefore the four straight lines BA, AD, DE, EB are equal to one another;
therefore the parallelogram ADEB is equilateral.
I say next that it is also right-angled.

For, since the straight line AD falls upon the parallels
AB, DE,

the angles BAD, ADE are equal to two right angles. [I. 29]
But the angle BAD is right;

therefore the angle ADE is also right.
And in parallelogrammic areas the opposite sides and
angles are equal to one another; [I. 34]

therefore each of the opposite angles ABE, BED is also right. Therefore ADEB is right-angled.
And it was also proved equilateral.

Therefore it is a square; and it is described on the straight line AB.

Q. E. F.

Proposition 47.
In right-angled triangles the square on the side subtending the right angle is equal to the squares on the sides containing the right angle.
Let ABC be a right-angled triangle having the angle
BAC right;
I say that the square on BC is equal to the squares on BA, AC.

For let there be described on BC the square BDEC,
and on BA, AC the squares GB, HC; [I. 46] through A let AL be drawn parallel to either BD or CE, and let AD, FC be joined.

Then, since each of the angles BAC, BAG is right, it follows that with a straight line BA, and at the point A on it, the two straight lines
AC, AG not lying on the same side make the adjacent angles equal to two right angles;

therefore CA is in a straight line with AG. [I. 14]

For the same reason

BA is also in a straight line with AH.
And, since the angle DBC is equal to the angle FBA: for each is right: let the angle ABC be added to each;

therefore the whole angle DBA is equal to the whole angle FBC. [C.N. 2]
And, since DB is equal to BC, and FB to BA, the two sides AB, BD are equal to the two sides FB, BC respectively,

and the angle ABD is equal to the angle FBC; therefore the base AD is equal to the base FC, and the triangle ABD is equal to the triangle FBC. [I. 4]
Now the parallelogram BL is double of the triangle ABD, for they have the same base BD and are in the same parallels
BD, AL. [I. 41]

And the square GB is double of the triangle FBC, for they again have the same base FB and are in the same parallels FB, GC. [I. 41]

[But the doubles of equals are equal to one another.]

Therefore the parallelogram BL is also equal to the square GB.
Similarly, if AE, BK be joined, the parallelogram CL can also be proved equal to the square HC;

therefore the whole square BDEC is equal to the two squares GB, HC. [C.N. 2]
And the square BDEC is described on BC,

and the squares GB, HC on BA, AC.
Therefore the square on the side BC is equal to the
squares on the sides BA, AC.

Therefore etc.

Proposition 48.
If in a triangle the square on one of the sides be equal to the squares on the remaining two sides of the triangle, the angle contained by the remaining two sides of the triangle is right.
For in the triangle ABC let the square on one side BC be equal to the squares on the sides BA, AC;
I say that the angle BAC is right.

For let AD be drawn from the point A at right angles to the straight line AC, let AD be made equal to BA, and let DC be joined.

Since DA is equal to AB, the square on DA is also equal to the square on AB.

Let the square on AC be added to each;

therefore the squares on DA, AC are equal to the squares on BA, AC.
But the square on DC is equal to the squares on DA, AC, for the angle DAC is right; [I. 47] and the square on BC is equal to the squares on BA, AC, for this is the hypothesis;

therefore the square on DC is equal to the square on BC, so that the side DC is also equal to BC.
And, since DA is equal to AB, and AC is common,

the two sides DA, AC are equal to the two sides BA, AC;
and the base DC is equal to the base BC;
therefore the angle DAC is equal to the angle BAC. [I. 8]
But the angle DAC is right;
therefore the angle BAC is also right.
Therefore etc.
BOOK II. PROPOSITIONS.
Proposition 1.
If there be two straight lines, and one of them be cut into any number of segments whatever, the rectangle contained by the two straight lines is equal to the rectangles contained by the uncut straight line and each of the segments.
Let A, BC be two straight lines, and let BC be cut at random at the points D, E; I say that the rectangle contained by A, BC is equal to the rectangle contained by A, BD, that contained by A, DE and
that contained by A, EC.

For let BF be drawn from B at right angles to BC; [I. 11] let BG be made equal to A, [I. 3] through G let GH be drawn
parallel to BC, [I. 31] and through D, E, C let DK, EL, CH be drawn parallel to BG.

Then BH is equal to BK, DL, EH.

Now BH is the rectangle A, BC, for it is contained by GB, BC, and BG is equal to A;

BK is the rectangle A, BD, for it is contained by GB, BD, and BG is equal to A;

and DL is the rectangle A, DE, for DK, that is BG [I. 34], is equal to A.
Similarly also EH is the rectangle A, EC.

Therefore the rectangle A, BC is equal to the rectangle A, BD, the rectangle A, DE and the rectangle A, EC.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D. 1

Proposition 2.
If a straight line be cut at random, the rectangle contained by the whole and both of the segments is equal to the square on the whole.
For let the straight line AB be cut at random at the point C; I say that the rectangle contained by AB, BC together with the rectangle contained by BA, AC is equal to the square on AB.

For let the square ADEB be described on AB [I. 46], and let CF be drawn through C parallel to either AD or BE. [I. 31]

Then AE is equal to AF, CE.

Now AE is the square on AB;

AF is the rectangle contained by BA, AC, for it is contained by DA, AC, and AD is equal to AB;

and CE is the rectangle AB, BC, for BE is equal to AB.
Therefore the rectangle BA, AC together with the rectangle AB, BC is equal to the square on AB.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

Proposition 3.
If a straight line be cut at random, the rectangle contained by the whole and one of the segments is equal to the rectangle contained by the segments and the square on the aforesaid segment.
For let the straight line AB be cut at random at C; I say that the rectangle contained by AB, BC is equal to the rectangle contained by AC, CB together with the square on BC.

For let the square CDEB be described on CB; [I. 46] let ED be drawn through to F, and through A let AF be drawn parallel to either CD or BE. [I. 31]

Then AE is equal to AD, CE.

Now AE is the rectangle contained by AB, BC, for it is contained by AB, BE, and BE is equal to BC;

AD is the rectangle AC, CB, for DC is equal to CB;

and DB is the square on CB
. Therefore the rectangle contained by AB, BC is equal to the rectangle contained by AC, CB together with the square on BC.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

Proposition 4.
If a straight line be cut at random, the square on the whole is equal to the squares on the segments and twice the rectangle contained by the segments.
For let the straight line AB be cut at random at C;
I say that the square on AB is equal to the squares on AC, CB and twice the rectangle contained by AC, CB.

For let the square ADEB be described on AB, [I. 46]
let BD be joined; through C let CF be drawn parallel to either AD or EB, and through G let HK be drawn parallel to either AB or DE. [I. 31]

Then, since CF is parallel to AD, and BD has fallen on them, the exterior angle CGB is equal to the interior and opposite angle ADB. [I. 29]

But the angle ADB is equal to the angle ABD,

since the side BA is also equal to AD; [I. 5]
therefore the angle CGB is also equal to the angle GBC, so that the side BC is also equal to the side CG. [I. 6]
But CB is equal to GK, and CG to KB; [I. 34]

therefore GK is also equal to KB; therefore CGKB is equilateral.
I say next that it is also right-angled.

For, since CG is parallel to BK,

the angles KBC, GCB are equal to two right angles. [I. 29]
But the angle KBC is right;

therefore the angle BCG is also right, so that the opposite angles CGK, GKB are also right. [I. 34]
Therefore CGKB is right-angled; and it was also proved equilateral;

therefore it is a square; and it is described on CB.
For the same reason

HF is also a square; and it is described on HG, that is AC. [I. 34]
Therefore the squares HF, KC are the squares on AC, CB.

Now, since AG is equal to GE, and AG is the rectangle AC, CB, for GC is equal to CB,

therefore GE is also equal to the rectangle AC, CB.
Therefore AG, GE are equal to twice the rectangle AC, CB.

But the squares HF, CK are also the squares on AC, CB; therefore the four areas HF, CK, AG, GE are equal to the squares on AC, CB and twice the rectangle contained by AC, CB.

But HF, CK, AG, GE are the whole ADEB,
which is the square on AB.

Therefore the square on AB is equal to the squares on AC, CB and twice the rectangle contained by AC, CB.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D. 2 3 4

Proposition 5.
If a straight line be cut into equal and unequal segments, the rectangle contained by the unequal segments of the whole together with the square on the straight line between the points of section is equal to the square on the half.
For let a straight line AB be cut into equal segments at C and into unequal segments at D; I say that the rectangle contained by AD, DB together with the square on CD is equal to the square on CB.

For let the square CEFB be described on CB, [I. 46] and let BE be joined; through D let DG be drawn parallel to either CE or BF, through H again let KM be drawn parallel to either AB or EF, and again through A let AK be drawn parallel to either CL or BM. [I. 31]

Then, since the complement CH is equal to the complement HF, [I. 43] let DM be added to each;

therefore the whole CM is equal to the whole DF.
But CM is equal to AL,

since AC is also equal to CB; [I. 36] therefore AL is also equal to DF.
Let CH be added to each;
therefore the whole AH is equal to the gnomon NOP.
But AH is the rectangle AD, DB, for DH is equal to DB,

therefore the gnomon NOP is also equal to the rectangle AD, DB.
Let LG, which is equal to the square on CD, be added to each;

therefore the gnomon NOP and LG are equal to the rectangle contained by AD, DB and the square on CD.
But the gnomon NOP and LG are the whole square CEFB, which is described on CB;

therefore the rectangle contained by AD, DB together with the square on CD is equal to the square on CB.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D. 5

Proposition 6.
If a straight line be bisected and a straight line be added to it in a straight line, the rectangle contained by the whole with the added straight line and the added straight line together with the square on the half is equal to the square on the straight line made up of the half and the added straight line.
For let a straight line AB be bisected at the point C, and let a straight line BD be added to it in a straight line;

I say that the rectangle contained by AD, DB together with the square on CB is equal to the square on CD.

For let the square CEFD be described on CD, [I. 46] and let DE be joined; through the point B let BG be drawn parallel to either EC or DF, through the point H let KM be drawn parallel to either AB or EF, and further through A let AK be drawn parallel to either CL or DM. [I. 31]

Then, since AC is equal to CB, AL is also equal to CH. [I. 36]
But CH is equal to HF. [I. 43]
Therefore AL is also equal to HF.
Let CM be added to each;

therefore the whole AM is equal to the gnomon NOP.
But AM is the rectangle AD, DB,

for DM is equal to DB; therefore the gnomon NOP is also equal to the rectangle AD, DB.
Let LG, which is equal to the square on BC, be added to each;

therefore the rectangle contained by AD, DB together with the square on CB is equal to the gnomon NOP and LG.
But the gnomon NOP and LG are the whole square CEFD, which is described on CD;

therefore the rectangle contained by AD, DB together with the square on CB is equal to the square on CD.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

Proposition 7.
If a straight line be cut at random, the square on the whole and that on one of the segments both together are equal to twice the rectangle contained by the whole and the said segment and the square on the remaining segment.
For let a straight line AB be cut at random at the point C;

I say that the squares on AB, BC are equal to twice the rectangle contained by AB, BC and the square on CA.

For let the square ADEB be described on AB, [I. 46] and let the figure be drawn.

Then, since AG is equal to GE, [I. 43] let CF be added to each;

therefore the whole AF is equal to the whole CE.
Therefore AF, CE are double of AF.

But AF, CE are the gnomon KLM and the square CF; therefore the gnomon KLM and the square CF are double of AF.

But twice the rectangle AB, BC is also double of AF; for BF is equal to BC; therefore the gnomon KLM and the square CF are equal to twice the rectangle AB, BC.

Let DG, which is the square on AC, be added to each; therefore the gnomon KLM and the squares BG, GD are equal to twice the rectangle contained by AB, BC and the square on AC.

But the gnomon KLM and the squares BG, GD are the whole ADEB and CF,

which are squares described on AB, BC;
therefore the squares on AB, BC are equal to twice the rectangle contained by AB, BC together with the square on AC.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

Proposition 8.
If a straight line be cut at random, four times the rectangle contained by the whole and one of the segments together with the square on the remaining segment is equal to the square described on the whole and the aforesaid segment as on one straight line.
For let a straight line AB be cut at random at the point C;

I say that four times the rectangle contained by AB, BC together with the square on AC is equal to the square described on AB, BC as on one straight line.

For let [the straight line] BD be produced in a straight line [with AB], and let BD be made equal to CB; let the square AEFD be described on AD, and let the figure be drawn double.

Then, since CB is equal to BD, while CB is equal to GK, and BD to KN, therefore GK is also equal to KN.

For the same reason

QR is also equal to RP.
And, since BC is equal to BD, and GK to KN, therefore CK is also equal to KD, and GR to RN. [I. 36]

But CK is equal to RN, for they are complements of the parallelogram CP; [I. 43] therefore KD is also equal to GR; therefore the four areas DK, CK, GR, RN are equal to one another.

Therefore the four are quadruple of CK.
Again, since CB is equal to BD, while BD is equal to BK, that is CG, and CB is equal to GK, that is GQ,

therefore CG is also equal to GQ.
And, since CG is equal to GQ, and QR to RP,

AG is also equal to MQ, and QL to RF. [I. 36]
But MQ is equal to QL, for they are complements of the parallelogram ML; [I. 43]

therefore AG is also equal to RF;
therefore the four areas AG, MQ, QL, RF are equal to one another.
Therefore the four are quadruple of AG.
But the four areas CK, KD, GR, RN were proved to be quadruple of CK;
therefore the eight areas, which contain the gnomon STU, are quadruple of AK.
Now, since AK is the rectangle AB, BD, for BK is equal to BD, therefore four times the rectangle AB, BD is quadruple of AK.

But the gnomon STU was also proved to be quadruple of AK;

therefore four times the rectangle AB, BD is equal to the gnomon STU.
Let OH, which is equal to the square on AC, be added to each;

therefore four times the rectangle AB, BD together with the square on AC is equal to the gnomon STU and OH.
But the gnomon STU and OH are the whole square AEFD,

which is described on AD.
therefore four times the rectangle AB, BD together with the square on AC is equal to the square on AD
But BD is equal to BC; therefore four times the rectangle contained by AB, BC together with the square on AC is equal to the square on AD, that is to the square described on AB and BC as on one straight line.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

Proposition 9.
If a straight line be cut into equal and unequal segments, the squares on the unequal segments of the whole are double of the square on the half and of the square on the straight line between the points of section.
For let a straight line AB be cut into equal segments at C, and into unequal segments at D;

I say that the squares on AD, DB are double of the squares on AC, CD.

For let CE be drawn from C at right angles to AB, and let it be made equal to either AC or CB; let EA, EB be joined, let DF be drawn through D parallel to EC, and FG through F parallel to AB, and let AF be joined.

Then, since AC is equal to CE,

the angle EAC is also equal to the angle AEC.
And, since the angle at C is right,

the remaining angles EAC, AEC are equal to one right angle. [I. 32]
And they are equal;

therefore each of the angles CEA, CAE is half a right angle.
For the same reason

each of the angles CEB, EBC is also half a right angle; therefore the whole angle AEB is right.
And, since the angle GEF is half a right angle, and the angle EGF is right, for it is equal to the interior and opposite angle ECB, [I. 29]

the remaining angle EFG is half a right angle; [I. 32] therefore the angle GEF is equal to the angle EFG, so that the side EG is also equal to GF. [I. 6]
Again, since the angle at B is half a right angle, and the angle FDB is right, for it is again equal to the interior and opposite angle ECB, [I. 29]

the remaining angle BFD is half a right angle; [I. 32] therefore the angle at B is equal to the angle DFB, so that the side FD is also equal to the side DB. [I. 6]
Now, since AC is equal to CE,

the square on AC is also equal to the square on CE; therefore the squares on AC, CE are double of the square on AC.
But the square on EA is equal to the squares on AC, CE, for the angle ACE is right; [I. 47]

therefore the square on EA is double of the square on AC.
Again, since EG is equal to GF,

the square on EG is also equal to the square on GF; therefore the squares on EG, GF are double of the square on GF.
But the square on EF is equal to the squares on EG, GF;

therefore the square on EF is double of the square on GF.
But GF is equal to CD; [I. 34] therefore the square on EF is double of the square on CD.

But the square on EA is also double of the square on AC;

therefore the squares on AE, EF are double of the squares on AC, CD.
And the square on AF is equal to the squares on AE, EF, for the angle AEF is right; [I. 47] therefore the square on AF is double of the squares on AC, CD.

But the squares on AD, DF are equal to the square on AF, for the angle at D is right; [I. 47] therefore the squares on AD, DF are double of the squares on AC, CD.

And DF is equal to DB; therefore the squares on AD, DB are double of the squares on AC, CD.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

Proposition 10.
If a straight line be bisected, and a straight line be added to it in a straight line, the square on the whole with the added straight line and the square on the added straight line both together are double of the square on the half and of the square described on the straight line made up of the half and the added straight line as on one straight line.
For let a straight line AB be bisected at C, and let a straight line BD be added to it in a straight line;

I say that the squares on AD, DB are double of the squares on AC, CD.

For let CE be drawn from the point C at right angles to AB [I. 11], and let it be made equal to either AC or CB [I. 3]; let EA, EB be joined; through E let EF be drawn parallel to AD, and through D let FD be drawn parallel to CE. [I. 31]

Then, since a straight line EF falls on the parallel straight lines EC, FD,

the angles CEF, EFD are equal to two right angles; [I. 29] therefore the angles FEB, EFD are less than two right angles.
But straight lines produced from angles less than two right angles meet; [I. Post. 5]

therefore EB, FD, if produced in the direction B, D, will meet.
Let them be produced and meet at G, and let AG be joined.

Then, since AC is equal to CE, the angle EAC is also equal to the angle AEC; [I. 5] and the angle at C is right;

therefore each of the angles EAC, AEC is half a right angle. [I. 32]
For the same reason

each of the angles CEB, EBC is also half a right angle; therefore the angle AEB is right.
And, since the angle EBC is half a right angle, the angle DBG is also half a right angle. [I. 15]

But the angle BDG is also right,
for it is equal to the angle DCE, they being alternate; [I. 29]
therefore the remaining angle DGB is half a right angle; [I. 32]
therefore the angle DGB is equal to the angle DBG,
so that the side BD is also equal to the side GD. [I. 6]
Again, since the angle EGF is half a right angle, and the angle at F is right, for it is equal to the opposite angle, the angle at C, [I. 34]

the remaining angle FEG is half a right angle; [I. 32] therefore the angle EGF is equal to the angle FEG, so that the side GF is also equal to the side EF. [I. 6]
Now, since the square on EC is equal to the square on CA, the squares on EC, CA are double of the square on CA.

But the square on EA is equal to the squares on EC, CA; [I. 47] therefore the square on EA is double of the square on AC. [C. N. 1]

Again, since FG is equal to EF, the square on FG is also equal to the square on FE; therefore the squares on GF, FE are double of the square on EF.

But the square on EG is equal to the squares on GF, FE; [I. 47] therefore the square on EG is double of the square on EF.

And EF is equal to CD; [I. 34]

therefore the square on EG is double of the square on CD.
But the square on EA was also proved double of the square on AC; therefore the squares on AE, EG are double of the squares on AC, CD.
And the square on AG is equal to the squares on AE, EG; [I. 47] therefore the square on AG is double of the squares on AC, CD. But the squares on AD, DG are equal to the square on AG; [I. 47] therefore the squares on AD, DG are double of the squares on AC, CD.

And DG is equal to DB; therefore the squares on AD, DB are double of the squares on AC, CD.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

Proposition 11.
To cut a given straight line so that the rectangle contained by the whole and one of the segments is equal to the square on the remaining segment.
Let AB be the given straight line; thus it is required to cut AB so that the rectangle contained by the whole and one of the segments is equal to the square on the remaining segment.

For let the square ABDC be described on AB; [I. 46] let AC be bisected at the point E, and let BE be joined; let CA be drawn through to F, and let EF be made equal to BE; let the square FH be described on AF, and let GH be drawn through to K.

I say that AB has been cut at H so as to make the rectangle contained by AB, BH equal to the square on AH.

For, since the straight line AC has been bisected at E, and FA is added to it,

the rectangle contained by CF, FA together with the square on AE is equal to the square on EF. [II. 6]
But EF is equal to EB;

therefore the rectangle CF, FA together with the square on AE is equal to the square on EB.
But the squares on BA, AE are equal to the square on EB, for the angle at A is right; [I. 47]

therefore the rectangle CF, FA together with the square on AE is equal to the squares on BA, AE.
Let the square on AE be subtracted from each;

therefore the rectangle CF, FA which remains is equal to the square on AB.
Now the rectangle CF, FA is FK, for AF is equal to FG; and the square on AB is AD;

therefore FK is equal to AD.
Let AK be subtracted from each;

therefore FH which remains is equal to HD.
And HD is the rectangle AB, BH, for AB is equal to BD; and FH is the square on AH;

therefore the rectangle contained by AB, BH is equal to the square on HA. therefore the given straight line AB has been cut at H so as to make the rectangle contained by AB, BH equal to the square on HA. Q. E. F.
Proposition 12.
In obtuse-angled triangles the square on the side subtending the obtuse angle is greater than the squares on the sides containing the obtuse angle by twice the rectangle contained by one of the sides about the obtuse angle, namely that on which the perpendicular falls, and the straight line cut off outside by the perpendicular towards the obtuse angle.
Let ABC be an obtuse-angled triangle having the angle BAC obtuse, and let BD be drawn from the point B perpendicular to CA produced;

I say that the square on BC is greater than the squares on BA, AC by twice the rectangle contained by CA, AD.

For, since the straight line CD has been cut at random at the point A, the square on DC is equal to the squares on CA, AD and twice the rectangle contained by CA, AD. [II. 4]

Let the square on DB be added to each; therefore the squares on CD, DB are equal to the squares on CA, AD, DB and twice the rectangle CA, AD.

But the square on CB is equal to the squares on CD, DB, for the angle at D is right; [I. 47]

and the square on AB is equal to the squares on AD, DB; [I. 47]
therefore the square on CB is equal to the squares on CA, AB and twice the rectangle contained by CA, AD;
so that the square on CB is greater than the squares on CA, AB by twice the rectangle contained by CA, AD.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

Proposition 13.
In acute-angled triangles the square on the side subtending the acute angle is less than the squares on the sides containing the acute angle by twice the rectangle contained by one of the sides about the acute angle, namely that on which the perpendicular falls, and the straight line cut off within by the perpendicular towards the acutc angle.
Let ABC be an acute-angled triangle having the angle at B acute, and let AD be drawn from the point A perpendicular to BC;

I say that the square on AC is less than the squares on CB, BA by twice the rectangle contained by CB, BD.

For, since the straight line CB has been cut at random at D,

the squares on CB, BD are equal to twice the rectangle contained by CB, BD and the square on DC. [II. 7]
Let the square on DA be added to each; therefore the squares on CB, BD, DA are equal to twice the rectangle contained by CB, BD and the squares on AD, DC.

But the square on AB is equal to the squares on BD, DA, for the angle at D is right; [I. 47] and the square on AC is equal to the squares on AD, DC; therefore the squares on CB, BA are equal to the square on AC and twice the rectangle CB, BD,

so that the square on AC alone is less than the squares on CB, BA by twice the rectangle contained by CB, BD.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

Proposition 14.
To construct a square equal to a given rectilineal figure.
Let A be the given rectilineal figure; thus it is required to construct a square equal to the rectilineal figure A.

For let there be constructed the rectangular parallelogram BD equal to the rectilineal figure A. [I. 45]

Then, if BE is equal to ED, that which was enjoined will have been done; for a square BD has been constructed equal to the rectilineal figure A.

But, if not, one of the straight lines BE, ED is greater.

Let BE be greater, and let it be produced to F; let EF be made equal to ED, and let BF be bisected at G.

With centre G and distance one of the straight lines GB, GF let the semicircle BHF be described; let DE be produced
to H, and let GH be joined.

Then, since the straight line BF has been cut into equal segments at G, and into unequal segments at E,

the rectangle contained by BE, EF together with the square on EG is equal to the square on GF. [II. 5]

But GF is equal to GH; therefore the rectangle BE, EF together with the square on GE is equal to the square on GH.

But the squares on HE, EG are equal to the square on GH; [I. 47]
therefore the rectangle BE, EF together with the square on GE is equal to the squares on HE, EG.

Let the square on GE be subtracted from each;

therefore the rectangle contained by BE, EF which remains is equal to the square on EH.

But the rectangle BE, EF is BD, for EF is equal to ED;

therefore the parallelogram BD is equal to the square on HE.
And BD is equal to the rectilineal figure A.

Therefore the rectilineal figure A is also equal to the square
which can be described on EH.

Therefore a square, namely that which can be described on EH, has been constructed equal to the given rectilineal figure A. Q. E. F.

BOOK III. PROPOSITIONS.
PROPOSITION 1.
To find the centre of a given circle.
Let ABC be the given circle; thus it is required to find the centre of the circle ABC.

Let a straight line AB be drawn
through it at random, and let it be bisected at the point D; from D let DC be drawn at right angles to AB and let it be drawn through to E; let CE be bisected at F;
I say that F is the centre of the circle ABC.

For suppose it is not, but, if possible, let G be the centre, and let GA, GD, GB be joined.

Then, since AD is equal to DB, and DG is common,

the two sides AD, DG are equal to the two sides BD, DG respectively;
and the base GA is equal to the base GB, for they are
radii;
therefore the angle ADG is equal to the angle GDB. [I. 8]
But, when a straight line set up on a straight line makes the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal angles is right; [I. Def. 10]

therefore the angle GDB is right.
But the angle FDB is also right; therefore the angle FDB is equal to the angle GDB, the greater to the less: which is impossible.

Therefore G is not the centre of the circle ABC.

Similarly we can prove that neither is any other point except F.

Therefore the point F is the centre of the circle ABC.
PORISM.
From this it is manifest that, if in a circle a straight line cut a straight line into two equal parts and at
right angles, the centre of the circle is on the cutting straight line. Q. E. F.

PROPOSITION 2.
If on the circumference of a circle two points be taken at random, the straight line joining the points will fall within the circle.
Let ABC be a circle, and let two points A, B be taken at random on its circumference; I say that the straight line joined from A to B will fall within the circle.

For suppose it does not, but, if possible, let it fall outside, as AEB; let the centre of the circle ABC be taken [III. 1], and let it be D; let DA, DB be joined, and let DFE be drawn through.

Then, since DA is equal to DB,

the angle DAE is also equal to the angle DBE. [I. 5]
And, since one side AEB of the triangle DAE is produced,
the angle DEB is greater than the angle DAE. [I. 16]
But the angle DAE is equal to the angle DBE;

therefore the angle DEB is greater than the angle DBE.
And the greater angle is subtended by the greater side; [I. 19]
therefore DB is greater than DE. But DB is equal to DF;
therefore DF is greater than DE,
the less than the greater : which is impossible.
Therefore the straight line joined from A to B will not fall outside the circle.

Similarly we can prove that neither will it fall on the circumference itself;

therefore it will fall within.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

PROPOSITION 3.
If in a circle a straight line through the centre bisect a straight line not through the centre, it also cuts it at right angles; and if it cut it at right angles, it also bisects it.
Let ABC be a circle, and in it let a straight line CD
through the centre bisect a straight line AB not through the centre at the point F; I say that it also cuts it at right angles.

For let the centre of the circle ABC
be taken, and let it be E; let EA, EB be joined.

Then, since AF is equal to FB, and FE is common,

two sides are equal to two sides;

and the base EA is equal to the base EB; therefore the angle AFE is equal to the angle BFE. [I. 8]
But, when a straight line set up on a straight line makes the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal angles is right; [I. Def. 10]

therefore each of the angles AFE, BFE is right.
Therefore CD, which is through the centre, and bisects AB which is not through the centre, also cuts it at right angles.

Again, let CD cut AB at right angles;
I say that it also bisects it. that is, that AF is equal to FB.

For, with the same construction,

since EA is equal to EB,
the angle EAF is also equal to the angle EBF. [I. 5]
But the right angle AFE is equal to the right angle BFE,
therefore EAF, EBF are two triangles having two angles equal to two angles and one side equal to one side, namely EF, which is common to them, and subtends one of the equal angles;

therefore they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides; [I. 26] therefore AF is equal to FB.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D. 3

PROPOSITION 4.
If in a circle two straight lines cut one another which are not through the centre, they do not bisect one another.
Let ABCD be a circle, and in it let the two straight lines AC, BD, which are not through the centre, cut one another at E; I say that they do not bisect one another.

For, if possible, let them bisect one another, so that AE is equal to EC, and BE to ED; let the centre of the circle ABCD be taken [III. 1], and let it be F; let FE be joined.

Then, since a straight line FE through the centre bisects a straight line AC not through the centre,

it also cuts it at right angles; [III. 3] therefore the angle FEA is right.
Again, since a straight line FE bisects a straight line BD,

it also cuts it at right angles; [III. 3] therefore the angle FEB is right.
But the angle FEA was also proved right;

therefore the angle FEA is equal to the angle FEB, the less to the greater: which is impossible.
Therefore AC, BD do not bisect one another.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

PROPOSITION 5.
If two circles cut one another, they will not have the same centre.
For let the circles ABC, CDG cut one another at the points B, C; I say that they will not have the same centre.

For, if possible, let it be E; let EC be joined, and let EFG be drawn through at random.

Then, since the point E is the centre of the circle ABC,

EC is equal to EF. [I. Def. 15]
Again, since the point E is the centre of the circle CDG,

EC is equal to EG.
But EC was proved equal to EF also;

therefore EF is also equal to EG, the less to the greater : which is impossible.
Therefore the point E is not the centre of the circles ABC, CDG.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

PROPOSITION 6.
If two circles touch one another, they will not have the same centre.
For let the two circles ABC, CDE touch one another at the point C; I say that they will not have the same centre.

For, if possible, let it be F; let FC be joined, and let FEB be drawn through at random.

Then, since the point F is the centre of the circle ABC,

FC is equal to FB.
Again, since the point F is the centre of the circle CDE,

FC is equal to FE.
But FC was proved equal to FB;

therefore FE is also equal to FB, the less to the greater: which is impossible.
Therefore F is not the centre of the circles ABC, CDE.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

PROPOSITION 7.
If on the diameter of a circle a point be taken which is not the centre of the circle, and from the point straight lines fall upon the circle, that will be greatest on which the centre is, the remainder of the same diameter will be least, and of the rest
the nearer to the straight line through the centre is always greater than the more remote, and only two equal straight lines will fall from the point on the circle, one on each side of the least straight line.
Let ABCD be a circle, and let AD be a diameter of it;
on AD let a point F be taken which is not the centre of the circle, let E be the centre of the circle, and from F let straight lines FB, FC, FG fall upon the circle ABCD; I say that FA is greatest, FD is least, and of the rest FB is
greater than FC, and FC than FG.

For let BE, CE, GE be joined.

Then, since in any triangle two sides are greater than the remaining one, [I. 20]

EB, EF are greater than BF.
But AE is equal to BE;

therefore AF is greater than BF.
Again, since BE is equal to CE, and FE is common,
the two sides BE, EF are equal to the two sides CE, EF.

But the angle BEF is also greater than the angle CEF; therefore the base BF is greater than the base CF. [I. 24]

For the same reason

CF is also greater than FG.

Again, since GF, FE are greater than EG, and EG is equal to ED,

GF, FE are greater than ED.
Let EF be subtracted from each;

therefore the remainder GF is greater than the remainder FD.
Therefore FA is greatest, FD is least, and FB is greater than FC, and FC than FG.

I say also that from the point F only two equal straight lines will fall on the circle ABCD, one on each side of the
least FD.

For on the straight line EF, and at the point E on it, let the angle FEH be constructed equal to the angle GEF [I. 23], and let FH be joined.

Then, since GE is equal to EH,
and EF is common,

the two sides GE, EF are equal to the two sides HE, EF; and the angle GEF is equal to the angle HEF;
therefore the base FG is equal to the base FH. [I. 4]
I say again that another straight line equal to FG will not
fall on the circle from the point F.

For, if possible, let FK so fall.

Then, since FK is equal to FG, and FH to FG,

FK is also equal to FH, the nearer to the straight line through the centre being thus equal to the more remote: which is impossible.
Therefore another straight line equal to GF will not fall from the point F upon the circle;

therefore only one straight line will so fall.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D. 4 5

PROPOSITION 8.
If a point be taken outside a circle and from the point straight lines be drawn through to the circle, one of which is through the centre and the others are drawn at random, then, of the straight lines which fall on the concave circumference, that through the centre is greatest, while of the rest the nearer to that through the centre is always greater than the more remote, but, of the straight lines falling on the convex circumference, that between the point and the diameter is least, while of the rest the nearer to the least is always less than the more remote, and only two equal straight lines will fall on the circle from the point, one on each side of the least.
Let ABC be a circle, and let a point D be taken outside ABC; let there be drawn through from it straight lines DA, DE, DF, DC, and let DA be through the centre; I say that, of the straight lines falling on the concave circumference AEFC, the straight line DA through the centre is greatest, while DE is greater than DF and DF than DC.; but, of the straight lines falling on the convex circumference HLKG, the straight line DG between the point and the diameter AG is least; and the nearer to the least DG is always less than the more remote, namely DK than DL, and DL than DH.

For let the centre of the circle ABC be taken [III. 1], and let it be M; let ME, MF, MC, MK, ML, MH be joined.

Then, since AM is equal to EM, let MD be added to each;

therefore AD is equal to EM, MD.
But EM, MD are greater than ED; [I. 20]

therefore AD is also greater than ED.
Again, since ME is equal to MF,

and MD is common,
therefore EM, MD are equal to FM, MD;
and the angle EMD is greater than the angle FMD;
therefore the base ED is greater than the base FD. [I. 24]
Similarly we can prove that FD is greater than CD; therefore DA is greatest, while DE is greater than DF, and DF than DC.

Next, since MK, KD are greater than MD, [I. 20] and MG is equal to MK, therefore the remainder KD is greater than the remainder GD,

so that GD is less than KD.
And, since on MD, one of the sides of the triangle MLD, two straight lines MK, KD were constructed meeting within the triangle, therefore MK, KD are less than ML, LD; [I. 21] and MK is equal to ML;

therefore the remainder DK is less than the remainder DL.
Similarly we can prove that DL is also less than DH;

therefore DG is least, while DK is less than DL, and DL than DH.
I say also that only two equal straight lines will fall from the point D on the circle, one on each side of the least DG.

On the straight line MD, and at the point M on it, let the angle DMB be constructed equal to the angle KMD, and let DB be joined.

Then, since MK is equal to MB, and MD is common,

the two sides KM, MD are equal to the two sides BM, MD respectively;
and the angle KMD is equal to the angle BMD;
therefore the base DK is equal to the base DB. [I. 4]
I say that no other straight line equal to the straight line DK will fall on the circle from the point D.

For, if possible, let a straight line so fall, and let it be DN.

Then, since DK is equal to DN,
while DK is equal to DB,

DB is also equal to DN,
that is, the nearer to the least DG equal to the more remote: which was proved impossible.
Therefore no more than two equal straight lines will fall on the circle ABC from the point D, one on each side of DG the least.

Therefore etc.

PROPOSITION 9.
If a point be taken within a circle, and more than two equal straight lines fall from the point on the circle, the point taken is the centre of the circle.
Let ABC be a circle and D a point within it, and from D let more than two equal straight lines, namely DA, DB, DC, fall on the circle ABC; I say that the point D is the centre of the circle ABC.

For let AB, BC be joined and bisected at the points E, F, and let ED, FD be joined and drawn through to the points G, K, H, L.

Then, since AE is equal to EB, and ED is common,

the two sides AE, ED are equal to the two sides BE, ED;
and the base DA is equal to the base DB;
therefore the angle AED is equal to the angle BED. [I. 8]
Therefore each of the angles AED, BED is right; [I. Def. 10] therefore GK cuts AB into two equal parts and at right angles.

And since, if in a circle a straight line cut a straight line into two equal parts and at right angles, the centre of the circle is on the cutting straight line, [III. 1, Por.]

the centre of the circle is on GK.
For the same reason

the centre of the circle ABC is also on HL.
And the straight lines GK, HL have no other point common but the point D;

therefore the point D is the centre of the circle ABC.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

PROPOSITION 10.
A circle does not cut a circle at more points than two.
For, if possible, let the circle ABC cut the circle DEF at more points than two, namely B, C, F, H;

let BH, BG be joined and bisected at the points K, L, and from K, L let KC, LM be drawn at right angles to BH, BG and carried through to the points A, E.

Then, since in the circle ABC a straight line AC cuts a straight line BH into two equal parts and at right angles,

the centre of the circle ABC is on AC. [III. 1, Por.]
Again, since in the same circle ABC a straight line NO cuts a straight line BG into two equal parts and at right angles,

the centre of the circle ABC is on NO.
But it was also proved to be on AC, and the straight lines AC, NO meet at no point except at P;

therefore the point P is the centre of the circle ABC.
Similarly we can prove that P is also the centre of the circle DEF;

therefore the two circles ABC, DEF which cut one another have the same centre P: which is impossible. [III. 5]
Therefore etc. Q. E. D. 6

PROPOSITION 11.
If two circles touch one another internally, and their centres be taken, the straight line joining their centres, if it be also produced, will fall on the point of contact of the circles.
For let the two circles ABC, ADE touch one another internally at the point A, and let the centre F of the circle ABC, and the centre G of ADE, be taken; I say that the straight line joined from G to F and produced will fall on A.

For suppose it does not, but, if possible, let it fall as FGH, and let AF, AG be joined.

Then, since AG, GF are greater than FA, that is, than FH,

let FG be subtracted from each; therefore the remainder AG is greater than the remainder GH.

But AG is equal to GD;

therefore GD is also greater than GH, the less than the greater: which is impossible.
Therefore the straight line joined from F to G will not fall outside;

therefore it will fall at A on the point of contact.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D. 7 8

PROPOSITION 12.
If two circles touch one another externally, the straight line joining their centres will pass through the point of contact.
For let the two circles ABC, ADE touch one another
externally at the point A, and let the centre F of ABC, and the centre G of ADE, be taken; I say that the straight line joined from F to G will pass through the point of contact at A.

For suppose it does not,
but, if possible, let it pass as FCDG, and let AF, AG be joined.

Then, since the point F is the centre of the circle ABC,

FA is equal to FC.
Again, since the point G is the centre of the circle ADE,

GA is equal to GD.
But FA was also proved equal to FC;

therefore FA, AG are equal to FC, GD, so that the whole FG is greater than FA, AG;
but it is also less [I. 20]: which is impossible.
Therefore the straight line joined from F to G will not fail to pass through the point of contact at A;

therefore it will pass through it.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.] 9

PROPOSITION 13.
A circle does not touch a circle at more points than one, whether it touch it internally or externally.
For, if possible, let the circle ABDC touch the circle EBFD, first internally, at more
points than one, namely D, B.

Let the centre G of the circle ABDC, and the centre H of EBFD, be taken.

Therefore the straight line
joined from G to H will fall on B, D. [III. 11]

Let it so fall, as BGHD.

Then, since the point G is the centre of the circle ABCD,

BG is equal to GD;
therefore BG is greater than HD; therefore BH is much greater than HD.
Again, since the point H is the centre of the circle EBFD,

BH is equal to HD;
but it was also proved much greater than it: which is impossible.
Therefore a circle does not touch a circle internally at more points than one.

I say further that neither does it so touch it externally.

For, if possible, let the circle ACK touch the circle ABDC at more points than one, namely A, C, and let AC be joined.

Then, since on the circumference of each of the circles
ABDC, ACK two points A, C have been taken at random, the straight line joining the points will fall within each circle; [III. 2]

but it fell within the circle ABCD and outside ACK [III. Def. 3]: which is absurd.

Therefore a circle does not touch a circle externally at more points than one.

And it was proved that neither does it so touch it internally.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D. 10 11

PROPOSITION 14.
In a circle equal straight lines are equally distant from the centre, and those which are equally distant from the centre are equal to one another.
Let ABDC be a circle, and let AB, CD be equal straight lines in it; I say that AB, CD are equally distant from the centre.

For let the centre of the circle ABDC be taken [III. 1], and let it be E; from E let EF, EG be drawn perpendicular to AB, CD, and let AE, EC be joined.

Then, since a straight line EF through the centre cuts a straight line AB not through the centre at right angles, it also bisects it. [III. 3]

Therefore AF is equal to FB; therefore AB is double of AF.
For the same reason

CD is also double of CG;
and AB is equal to CD;
therefore AF is also equal to CG.
And, since AE is equal to EC,

the square on AE is also equal to the square on EC.
But the squares on AF, EF are equal to the square on AE, for the angle at F is right; and the squares on EG, GC are equal to the square on EC, for the angle at G is right; [I. 47]
therefore the squares on AF, FE are equal to the squares on CG, GE,
of which the square on AF is equal to the square on CG, for AF is equal to CG;
therefore the square on FE which remains is equal to the square on EG, therefore EF is equal to EG.
But in a circle straight lines are said to be equally distant from the centre when the perpendiculars drawn to them from the centre are equal; [III. Def. 4]

therefore AB, CD are equally distant from the centre.
Next, let the straight lines AB, CD be equally distant from the centre; that is, let EF be equal to EG.

I say that AB is also equal to CD.

For, with the same construction, we can prove, similarly, that AB is double of AF, and CD of CG.

And, since AE is equal to CE,

the square on AE is equal to the square on CE.
But the squares on EF, FA are equal to the square on AE, and the squares on EG, GC equal to the square on CE. [I. 47]
Therefore the squares on EF, FA are equal to the squares on EG, GC, of which the square on EF is equal to the square on EG, for EF is equal to EG; therefore the square on AF which remains is equal to the square on CG;

therefore AF is equal to CG.
And AB is double of AF, and CD double of CG;
therefore AB is equal to CD.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

PROPOSITION 15.
Of straight lines in a circle the diameter is greatest, and of the rest the nearer to the centre is always greater than the more remote.
Let ABCD be a circle, let AD be its diameter and E the centre; and let BC be nearer to the diameter AD, and FG more remote; I say that AD is greatest and BC greater than FG.

For from the centre E let EH, EK be drawn perpendicular to BC, FG.

Then, since BC is nearer to the centre and FG more remote, EK is greater than EH. [III. Def. 5]

Let EL be made equal to EH, through L let LM be drawn at right angles to EK and carried through to N, and let ME, EN, FE, EG be joined.

Then, since EH is equal to EL,

BC is also equal to MN. [III. 14]
Again, since AE is equal to EM, and ED to EN,

AD is equal to ME, EN.
But ME, EN are greater than MN, [I. 20] and MN is equal to BC;

therefore AD is greater than BC.
And, since the two sides ME, EN are equal to the two sides FE, EG, and the angle MEN greater than the angle FEG, therefore the base MN is greater than the base FG. [I. 24]

But MN was proved equal to BC.

Therefore the diameter AD is greatest and BC greater than FG.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D. 12 13

PROPOSITION 16.
The straight line drawn at right angles to the diameter of a circle from its extremity will fall outside the circle, and into the space between the straight line and the circumference another straight line cannot be interposed; further the angle of the semicircle is greater, and the remaining angle less, than any acute rectilineal angle.
Let ABC be a circle about D as centre and AB as diameter; I say that the straight line drawn from A at right angles to AB from its extremity will fall outside the circle.

For suppose it does not, but, if possible, let it fall within as CA, and let DC be joined.

Since DA is equal to DC,

the angle DAC is also equal to the angle ACD. [I. 5]
But the angle DAC is right;

therefore the angle ACD is also right:
thus, in the triangle ACD, the two angles DAC, ACD are equal to two right angles: which is impossible. [I. 17]
Therefore the straight line drawn from the point A at right angles to BA will not fall within the circle.

Similarly we can prove that neither will it fall on the circumference;

therefore it will fall outside.
Let it fall as AE; I say next that into the space between the straight line AE and the circumference CHA another straight line cannot be interposed.

For, if possible, let another straight line be so interposed, as FA, and let DG be drawn from the point D perpendicular to FA.

Then, since the angle AGD is right,

and the angle DAG is less than a right angle, AD is greater than DG. [I. 19]
But DA is equal to DH;

therefore DH is greater than DG, the less than the greater: which is impossible.
Therefore another straight line cannot be interposed into the space between the straight line and the circumference.

I say further that the angle of the semicircle contained by the straight line BA and the circumference CHA is greater than any acute rectilineal angle, and the remaining angle contained by the circumference CHA and the straight line AE is less than any acute rectilineal angle.

For, if there is any rectilineal angle greater than the angle contained by the straight line BA and the circumference CHA, and any rectilineal angle less than the angle contained by the circumference CHA and the straight line AE, then into the space between the circumference and the straight line AE a straight line will be interposed such as will make an angle contained by straight lines which is greater than the angle contained by the straight line BA and the circumference CHA, and another angle contained by straight lines which is less than the angle contained by the circumference CHA and the straight line AE.

But such a straight line cannot be interposed;

therefore there will not be any acute angle contained by straight lines which is greater than the angle contained by the straight line BA and the circumference CHA, nor yet any acute angle contained by straight lines which is less than the angle contained by the circumference CHA and the straight line AE.—

From this it is manifest that the straight line drawn at right angles to the diameter of a circle from its extremity touches the circle. Q. E. D.

From a given point to draw a straight line touching a given circle.
Let A be the given point, and BCD the given circle; thus it is required to draw from the point A a straight line touching the circle BCD.

For let the centre E of the circle be taken; [III. 1] let AE be joined, and with centre E and distance EA let the circle AFG be described; from D let DF be drawn at right angles to EA, and let EF, AB be joined; I say that AB has been drawn from the point A touching the circle BCD.

For, since E is the centre of the circles BCD, AFG,

EA is equal to EF, and ED to EB;
therefore the two sides AE, EB are equal to the two sides FE, ED: and they contain a common angle, the angle at E;
therefore the base DF is equal to the base AB, and the triangle DEF is equal to the triangle BEA, and the remaining angles to the remaining angles; [I. 4] therefore the angle EDF is equal to the angle EBA.
But the angle EDF is right;

therefore the angle EBA is also right.
Now EB is a radius; and the straight line drawn at right angles to the diameter of a circle, from its extremity, touches the circle; [III. 16, Por.]

therefore AB touches the circle BCD.
Therefore from the given point A the straight line AB has been drawn touching the circle BCD.

PROPOSITION 18.
If a straight line touch a circle, and a straight line be joined from the centre to the point of contact, the straight line so joined will be perpendicular to the tangent.
For let a straight line DE touch the circle ABC at the point C, let the centre F of the circle ABC be taken, and let FC be joined from F to C; I say that FC is perpendicular to DE.

For, if not, let FG be drawn from F perpendicular to DE.

Then, since the angle FGC is right,

the angle FCG is acute; [I. 17]
and the greater angle is subtended by the greater side; [I. 19]
therefore FC is greater than FG.
But FC is equal to FB;

therefore FB is also greater than FG, the less than the greater: which is impossible.
Therefore FG is not perpendicular to DE.

Similarly we can prove that neither is any other straight line except FC;

therefore FC is perpendicular to DE.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.15

PROPOSITION 19.
If a straight line touch a circle, and from the point of contact a straight line be drawn at right angles to the tangent, the centre of the circle will be on the straight line so drawn.
For let a straight line DE touch the circle ABC at the point C, and from C let CA be drawn at right angles to DE; I say that the centre of the circle is on AC.

For suppose it is not, but, if possible, let F be the centre, and let CF be joined.

Since a straight line DE touches the circle ABC, and FC has been joined from the centre to the point of contact,

FC is perpendicular to DE; [III. 18] therefore the angle FCE is right.
But the angle ACE is also right;

therefore the angle FCE is equal to the angle ACE, the less to the greater: which is impossible.
Therefore F is not the centre of the circle ABC.

Similarly we can prove that neither is any other point except a point on AC.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

PROPOSITION 20.
In a circle the angle at the centre is double of the angle at the circumference, when the angles have the same circumference as base.
Let ABC be a circle, let the angle BEC be an angle
at its centre, and the angle BAC an angle at the circumference, and let them have the same circumference BC as base; I say that the angle BEC is double of
the angle BAC.

For let AE be joined and drawn through to F.

Then, since EA is equal to EB,

the angle EAB is also equal to the angle EBA; [I. 5]
therefore the angles EAB, EBA are double of the angle EAB.
But the angle BEF is equal to the angles EAB, EBA; [I. 32] therefore the angle BEF is also double of the angle
EAB.

For the same reason

the angle FEC is also double of the angle EAC.
Therefore the whole angle BEC is double of the whole angle BAC.

Again let another straight line be inflected, and let there be another angle BDC; let DE be joined and produced to G.

Similarly then we can prove that the angle GEC is double of the angle EDC,

of which the angle GEB is double of the angle EDB; therefore the angle BEC which remains is double of the angle BDC.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D. 17

In a circle the angles in the same segment are equal to one another.
Let ABCD be a circle, and let the angles BAD, BED be angles in the same segment BAED; I say that the angles BAD, BED are equal to one another.

For let the centre of the circle ABCD be taken, and let it be F; let BF, FD be joined.

Now, since the angle BFD is at the centre,

and the angle BAD at the circumference, and they have the same circumference BCD as base, therefore the angle BFD is double of the angle BAD. [III. 20]
For the same reason

the angle BFD is also double of the angle BED; therefore the angle BAD is equal to the angle BED.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

PROPOSITION 22.
The opposite angles of quadrilaterals in circles are equal to two right angles.
Let ABCD be a circle, and let ABCD be a quadrilateral in it; I say that the opposite angles are equal to two right angles.

Let AC, BD be joined.

Then, since in any triangle the three angles are equal to two right angles, [I. 32]

the three angles CAB, ABC, BCA of the triangle ABC are equal to two right angles.
But the angle CAB is equal to the angle BDC, for they are in the same segment BADC; [III. 21] and the angle ACB is equal to the angle ADB, for they are in the same segment ADCB; therefore the whole angle ADC is equal to the angles BAC, ACB.

Let the angle ABC be added to each; therefore the angles ABC, BAC, ACB are equal to the angles ABC, ADC. But the angles ABC, BAC, ACB are equal to two right angles; therefore the angles ABC, ADC are also equal to two right angles.

Similarly we can prove that the angles BAD, DCB are also equal to two right angles.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

On the same straight line there cannot be constructed two similar and unequal segments of circles on the same side.
For, if possible, on the same straight line AB let two similar and unequal segments of circles ACB, ADB be constructed on the same side; let ACD be drawn through, and let CB, DB be joined.

Then, since the segment ACB is similar to the segment ADB, and similar segments of circles are those which admit equal angles, [III. Def. 11]

the angle ACB is equal to the angle ADB, the exterior to the interior: which is impossible. [I. 16]
Therefore etc. Q. E. D. 18

PROPOSITION 24.
Similar segments of circles on equal straight lines are equal to one another.
For let AEB, CFD be similar segments of circles on equal straight lines AB, CD;
I say that the segment AEB is equal to the segment CFD.

For, if the segment AEB be applied to CFD, and if the point A be placed on C and the straight line AB on CD,

the point B will also coincide with the point D, because AB is equal to CD;

and, AB coinciding with CD, the segment AEB will also coincide with CFD.
For, if the straight line AB coincide with CD but the segment AEB do not coincide with CFD, it will either fall with it, or outside it;
or it will fall awry, as CGD, and a circle cuts a circle at more points than two : which is impossible. [III. 10]

Therefore, if the straight line AB be applied to CD, the segment AEB will not fail to coincide with CFD also;

therefore it will coincide with it and will be equal to it.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D. 19

PROPOSITION 25.
Given a segment of a circle, to describe the complete circle of which it is a segment.
Let ABC be the given segment of a circle; thus it is required to describe the complete circle belonging to the segment ABC, that is, of which it is a segment.

For let AC be bisected at D, let DB be drawn from the point D at right angles to AC, and let AB. be joined;

the angle ABD is then greater than, equal to, or less than the angle BAD.
First let it be greater; and on the straight line BA, and at the point A on it, let the angle BAE be constructed equal to the angle ABD; let DB be drawn through to E, and let EC be joined.

Then, since the angle ABE is equal to the angle BAE,

the straight line EB is also equal to EA. [I. 6]
And, since AD is equal to DC, and DE is common,

the two sides AD, DE are equal to the two sides CD, DE respectively;
and the angle ADE is equal to the angle CDE, for each is right;
therefore the base AE is equal to the base CE.
But AE was proved equal to BE;

therefore BE is also equal to CE;
therefore the three straight lines AE, EB, EC are equal to one another.
Therefore the circle drawn with centre E and distance one of the straight lines AE, EB, EC will also pass through the remaining points and will have been completed. [III. 9]

Therefore, given a segment of a circle, the complete circle has been described.

And it is manifest that the segment ABC is less than a semicircle, because the centre E happens to be outside it.

Similarly, even if the angle ABD be equal to the angle BAD, AD being equal to each of the two BD, DC,

the three straight lines DA, DB, DC will be equal to one another, D will be the centre of the completed circle, and ABC will clearly be a semicircle.
But, if the angle ABD be less than the angle BAD, and if we construct, on the straight line BA and at the point A on it, an angle equal to the angle ABD, the centre will fall on DB within the segment ABC, and the segment ABC will clearly be greater than a semicircle.

Therefore, given a segment of a circle, the complete circle has been described. Q. E. F. 20

In equal circles equal angles stand on equal circumferences, whether they stand at the centres or at the circumferences.
Let ABC, DEF be equal circles, and in them let there be equal angles, namely at the centres the angles BGC, EHF, and at the circumferences the angles BAC, EDF; I say that the circumference BKC is equal to the circumference ELF.

For let BC, EF be joined.

Now, since the circles ABC, DEF are equal,

the radii are equal.
Thus the two straight lines BG, GC are equal to the two straight lines EH, HF;

and the angle at G is equal to the angle at H; therefore the base BC is equal to the base EF. [I. 4]
And, since the angle at A is equal to the angle at D,

the segment BAC is similar to the segment EDF; [III. Def. 11]
and they are upon equal straight lines.
But similar segments of circles on equal straight lines are equal to one another; [III. 24]

therefore the segment BAC is equal to EDF.
But the whole circle ABC is also equal to the whole circle DEF; therefore the circumference BKC which remains is equal to the circumference ELF.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

PROPOSITION 27.
In equal circles angles standing on equal circumferences are equal to one another, whether they stand at the centres or at the circumferences.
For in equal circles ABC, DEF, on equal circumferences BC, EF, let the angles BGC, EHF stand at the centres G, H, and the angles BAC, EDF at the circumferences; I say that the angle BGC is equal to the angle EHF, and the angle BAC is equal to the angle EDF.

For, if the angle BGC is unequal to the angle EHF,

one of them is greater.
Let the angle BGC be greater : and on the straight line BG, and at the point G on it, let the angle BGK be constructed equal to the angle EHF. [I. 23]
Now equal angles stand on equal circumferences, when they are at the centres; [III. 26]

therefore the circumference BK is equal to the circumference EF.
But EF is equal to BC;

therefore BK is also equal to BC, the less to the greater : which is impossible.
Therefore the angle BGC is not unequal to the angle EHF;

therefore it is equal to it.
And the angle at A is half of the angle BGC,

and the angle at D half of the angle EHF; [III. 20]
therefore the angle at A is also equal to the angle at D.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

PROPOSITION 28.
In equal circles equal straight lines cut off equal circumferences, the greater equal to the greater and the less to the less.
Let ABC, DEF be equal circles, and in the circles let AB, DE be equal straight lines cutting off ACB, DFE as greater circumferences and AGB, DHE as lesser; I say that the greater circumference ACB is equal to the greater circumference DFE, and the less circumference AGB to DHE.

For let the centres K, L of the circles be taken, and let AK, KB, DL, LE be joined.

Now, since the circles are equal,

the radii are also equal; therefore the two sides AK, KB are equal to the two sides DL, LE;
and the base AB is equal to the base DE;
therefore the angle AKB is equal to the angle DLE. [I. 8]
But equal angles stand on equal circumferences, when they are at the centres; [III. 26]

therefore the circumference AGB is equal to DHE.
And the whole circle ABC is also equal to the whole circle DEF; therefore the circumference ACB which remains is also equal to the circumference DFE which remains.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

PROPOSITION 29.
In equal circles equal circumferences are subtended by equal straight lines.
Let ABC, DEF be equal circles, and in them let equal circumferences BGC, EHF be cut off; and let the straight lines BC, EF be joined; I say that BC is equal to EF.

For let the centres of the circles be taken, and let them be K, L; let BK, KC, EL, LF be joined.

Now, since the circumference BGC is equal to the circumference EHF,

the angle BKC is also equal to the angle ELF. [III. 27]
And, since the circles ABC, DEF are equal,

the radii are also equal; therefore the two sides BK, KC are equal to the two sides EL, LF; and they contain equal angles; therefore the base BC is equal to the base EF. [I. 4]
Therefore etc.

PROPOSITION 30.
To bisect a given circumference.
Let ADB be the given circumference; thus it is required to bisect the circumference ADB.

Let AB be joined and bisected at C; from the point C let CD be drawn at right angles to the straight line AB, and let AD, DB be joined.

Then, since AC is equal to CB, and CD is common,

the two sides AC, CD are equal to the two sides BC, CD;
and the angle ACD is equal to the angle BCD, for each is right;
therefore the base AD is equal to the base DB. [I. 4]
But equal straight lines cut off equal circumferences, the greater equal to the greater, and the less to the less; [III. 28]

and each of the circumferences AD, DB is less than a semicircle; therefore the circumference AD is equal to the circumference DB.
Therefore the given circumference has been bisected at the point D. Q. E. F.

PROPOSITION 31.
In a circle the angle in the semicircle is right, that in a greater segment less than a right angle, and that in a less segment greater than a right angle; and further the angle of the greater segment is greater than a right angle, and the angle of the less segment less than a right angle.
Let ABCD be a circle, let BC be its diameter, and E its centre, and let BA, AC, AD, DC be joined; I say that the angle BAC in the semicircle BAC is right, the angle ABC in the segment ABC greater than the semicircle is less than a right angle, and the angle ADC in the segment ADC less than the semicircle is greater than a right angle.

Let AE be joined, and let BA be carried through to F.

Then, since BE is equal to EA,

the angle ABE is also equal to the angle BAE. [I. 5]
Again, since CE is equal to EA,

the angle ACE is also equal to the angle CAE. [I. 5]
Therefore the whole angle BAC is equal to the two angles ABC, ACB.

But the angle FAC exterior to the triangle ABC is also equal to the two angles ABC, ACB; [I. 32]

therefore the angle BAC is also equal to the angle FAC; therefore each is right; [I. Def. 10] therefore the angle BAC in the semicircle BAC is right.
Next, since in the triangle ABC the two angles ABC, BAC are less than two right angles, [I. 17] and the angle BAC is a right angle,

the angle ABC is less than a right angle;
and it is the angle in the segment ABC greater than the semicircle.
Next, since ABCD is a quadrilateral in a circle, and the opposite angles of quadrilaterals in circles are equal to two right angles, [III. 22] while the angle ABC is less than a right angle, therefore the angle ADC which remains is greater than a right angle; and it is the angle in the segment ADC less than the semicircle.

I say further that the angle of the greater segment, namely that contained by the circumference ABC and the straight line AC, is greater than a right angle; and the angle of the less segment, namely that contained by the circumference ADC and the straight line AC, is less than a right angle.

This is at once manifest. For, since the angle contained by the straight lines BA, AC is right,

the angle contained by the circumference ABC and the straight line AC is greater than a right angle.
Again, since the angle contained by the straight lines AC, AF is right,

the angle contained by the straight line CA and the circumference ADC is less than a right angle.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

PROPOSITION 32.
If a straight line touch a circle, and from the point of contact there be drawn across, in the circle, a straight line cutting the circle, the angles which it makes with the tangent will be equal to the angles in the alternate segments of the circle.
For let a straight line EF touch the circle ABCD at the point B, and from the point B let there be drawn across, in the circle ABCD, a straight line BD cutting it; I say that the angles which BD makes with the tangent EF will be equal to the angles in the alternate segments of the circle, that is, that the angle FBD is equal to the angle constructed in the segment BAD, and the angle EBD is equal to the angle constructed in the segment DCB.

For let BA be drawn from B at right angles to EF, let a point C be taken at random on the circumference BD, and let AD, DC, CB be joined.

Then, since a straight line EF touches the circle ABCD at B, and BA has been drawn from the point of contact at right angles to the tangent, the centre of the circle ABCD is on BA. [III. 19]

Therefore BA is a diameter of the circle ABCD;

therefore the angle ADB, being an angle in a semicircle, is right. [III. 31]
Therefore the remaining angles BAD, ABD are equal to one right angle. [I. 32]

But the angle ABF is also right; therefore the angle ABF is equal to the angles BAD, ABD.

Let the angle ABD be subtracted from each; therefore the angle DBF which remains is equal to the angle BAD in the alternate segment of the circle.

Next, since ABCD is a quadrilateral in a circle, its opposite angles are equal to two right angles. [III. 22]

But the angles DBF, DBE are also equal to two right angles; therefore the angles DBF, DBE are equal to the angles BAD, BCD,

of which the angle BAD was proved equal to the angle DBF; therefore the angle DBE which remains is equal to the angle DCB in the alternate segment DCB of the circle.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

PROPOSITION 33.
On a given straight line to describe a segment of a circle admitting an angle equal to a given rectilineal angle.
Let AB be the given straight line, and the angle at C the given rectilineal angle; thus it is required to describe on the given straight line AB a segment of a circle admitting an angle equal to the angle at C.

The angle at C is then acute, or right, or obtuse.

First let it be acute, and, as in the first figure, on the straight line AB, and at the point A, let the angle BAD be constructed equal to the angle at C;

therefore the angle BAD is also acute.
Let AE be drawn at right angles to DA, let AB be bisected at F, let FG be drawn from the point F at right angles to AB, and let GB be joined.

Then, since AF is equal to FB, and FG is common,

the two sides AF, FG are equal to the two sides BF, FG;
and the angle AFG is equal to the angle BFG;
therefore the base AG is equal to the base BG. [I. 4]
Therefore the circle described with centre G and distance GA will pass through B also.

Let it be drawn, and let it be ABE; let EB be joined.

Now, since AD is drawn from A, the extremity of the diameter AE, at right angles to AE,

therefore AD touches the circle ABE. [III. 16, Por.]
Since then a straight line AD touches the circle ABE, and from the point of contact at A a straight line AB is drawn across in the circle ABE,

the angle DAB is equal to the angle AEB in the alternate segment of the circle. [III. 32]
But the angle DAB is equal to the angle at C; therefore the angle at C is also equal to the angle AEB.

Therefore on the given straight line AB the segment AEB of a circle has been described admitting the angle AEB equal to the given angle, the angle at C.

Next let the angle at C be right; and let it be again required to describe on AB a segment of a circle admitting an angle equal to the right angle at C.

Let the angle BAD be constructed equal to the right angle at C, as is the case in the second figure; let AB be bisected at F, and with centre F and distance either FA or FB let the circle AEB be described.

Therefore the straight line AD touches the circle ABE, because the angle at A is right. [III. 16, Por.]

And the angle BAD is equal to the angle in the segment AEB, for the latter too is itself a right angle, being an angle in a semicircle. [III. 31]

But the angle BAD is also equal to the angle at C.

Therefore the angle AEB is also equal to the angle at C.

Therefore again the segment AEB of a circle has been described on AB admitting an angle equal to the angle at C.

Next, let the angle at C be obtuse; and on the straight line AB, and at the point A, let the angle BAD be constructed equal to it, as is the case in the third figure; let AE be drawn at right angles to AD, let AB be again bisected at F, let FG be drawn at right angles to AB, and let GB be joined.

Then, since AF is again equal to FB, and FG is common,

the two sides AF, FG are equal to the two sides BF, FG;
and the angle AFG is equal to the angle BFG;
therefore the base AG is equal to the base BG. [I. 4]
Therefore the circle described with centre G and distance GA will pass through B also; let it so pass, as AEB.

Now, since AD is drawn at right angles to the diameter AE from its extremity,

AD touches the circle AEB. [III. 16, Por.]
And AB has been drawn across from the point of contact at A;

therefore the angle BAD is equal to the angle constructed in the alternate segment AHB of the circle. [III. 32]
But the angle BAD is equal to the angle at C.

Therefore the angle in the segment AHB is also equal to the angle at C.

Therefore on the given straight line AB the segment AHB of a circle has been described admitting an angle equal to the angle at C. Q. E. F.

PROPOSITION 34.
From a given circle to cut off a segment admitting an angle equal to a given rectilineal angle.
Let ABC be the given circle, and the angle at D the given rectilineal angle; thus it is required to cut off from the circle ABC a segment admitting an angle equal to the given rectilineal angle, the angle at D.

Let EF be drawn touching ABC at the point B, and on the straight line FB, and at the point B on it, let the angle FBC be constructed equal to the angle at D. [I. 23]

Then, since a straight line EF touches the circle ABC,

and BC has been drawn across from the point of contact at B,
the angle FBC is equal to the angle constructed in the alternate segment BAC. [III. 32]
But the angle FBC is equal to the angle at D;

therefore the angle in the segment BAC is equal to the angle at D.
Therefore from the given circle ABC the segment BAC. has been cut off admitting an angle equal to the given rectilineal angle, the angle at D. Q. E. F.

PROPOSITION 35.
If in a circle two straight lines cut one another, the rectangle contained by the segments of the one is equal to the rectangle contained by the segments of the other.
For in the circle ABCD let the two straight lines AC, BD cut one another at the point E; I say that the rectangle contained by AE, EC is equal to the rectangle contained by DE, EB.

If now AC, BD are through the centre, so that E is the centre of the circle ABCD, it is manifest that, AE, EC, DE, EB being equal, the rectangle contained by AE, EC is also equal to the rectangle contained by DE, EB.

Next let AC, DB not be through the centre; let the centre of ABCD be taken, and let it be F; from F let FG, FH be drawn perpendicular to the straight lines AC, DB, and let FB, FC, FE be joined.

Then, since a straight line GF through the centre cuts a straight line AC not through the centre at right angles,

it also bisects it; [III. 3] therefore AG is equal to GC.
Since, then, the straight line AC has been cut into equal parts at G and into unequal parts at E, the rectangle contained by AE, EC together with the square on EG is equal to the square on GC; [II. 5]

Let the square on GF be added; therefore the rectangle AE, EC together with the squares on GE, GF is equal to the squares on CG, GF.

But the square on FE is equal to the squares on EG, GF, and the square on FC is equal to the squares on CG, GF; [I. 47]

therefore the rectangle AE, EC together with the square on FE is equal to the square on FC.
And FC is equal to FB; therefore the rectangle AE, EC together with the square on EF is equal to the square on FB.

For the same reason, also, the rectangle DE, EB together with the square on FE is equal to the square on FB.

But the rectangle AE, EC together with the square on FE was also proved equal to the square on FB; therefore the rectangle AE, EC together with the square on FE is equal to the rectangle DE, EB together with the square on FE.

Let the square on FE be subtracted from each; therefore the rectangle contained by AE, EC which remains is equal to the rectangle contained by DE, EB.

Therefore etc.

PROPOSITION 36.
If a point be taken outside a circle and from it there fall on the circle two straight lines, and if one of them cut the circle and the other touch it, the rectangle contained by the whole of the straight line which cuts the circle and the straight line intercepted on it outside between the point and the convex circumference will be equal to the square on the tangent.
For let a point D be taken outside the circle ABC, and from D let the two straight lines DCA, DB fall on the circle ABC; let DCA cut the circle ABC and let BD touch it; I say that the rectangle contained by AD, DC is equal to the square on DB.

Then DCA is either through the centre or not through the centre.

First let it be through the centre, and let F be the centre of the circle ABC; let FB be joined;

therefore the angle FBD is right. [III. 18]
And, since AC has been bisected at F, and CD is added to it, the rectangle AD, DC together with the square on FC is equal to the square on FD. [II. 6]

But FC is equal to FB; therefore the rectangle AD, DC together with the square on FB is equal to the square on FD.

And the squares on FB, BD are equal to the square on FD; [I. 47] therefore the rectangle AD, DC together with the square on FB is equal to the squares on FB, BD.

Let the square on FB be subtracted from each; therefore the rectangle AD, DC which remains is equal to the square on the tangent DB.

Again, let DCA not be through the centre of the circle ABC; let the centre E be taken, and from E let EF be drawn perpendicular to AC; let EB, EC, ED be joined.

Then the angle EBD is right. [III. 18]

And, since a straight line EF through the centre cuts a straight line AC not through the centre at right angles,

it also bisects it; [III. 3] therefore AF is equal to FC.
Now, since the straight line AC has been bisected at the point F, and CD is added to it, the rectangle contained by AD, DC together with the square on FC is equal to the square on FD. [II. 6]

Let the square on FE be added to each; therefore the rectangle AD, DC together with the squares on CF, FE is equal to the squares on FD, FE.

But the square on EC is equal to the squares on CF, FE, for the angle EFC is right; [I. 47] and the square on ED is equal to the squares on DF, FE; therefore the rectangle AD, DC together with the square on EC is equal to the square on ED.

And EC is equal to EB; therefore the rectangle AD, DC together with the square on EB is equal to the square on ED.

But the squares on EB, BD are equal to the square on ED, for the angle EBD is right; [I. 47] therefore the rectangle AD, DC together with the square on EB is equal to the squares on EB, BD.

Let the square on EB be subtracted from each; therefore the rectangle AD, DC which remains is equal to the square on DB.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

PROPOSITION 37.
If a point be taken outside a circle and from the point there fall on the circle two straight lines, if one of them cut the circle, and the other fall on it, and if further the rectangle contained by the whole of the straight line which cuts the circle and the straight line intercepted on it outside between the point and the convex circumference be equal to the square on the straight line which falls on the circle, the straight line which falls on it will touch the circle.
For let a point D be taken outside the circle ABC; from D let the two straight lines DCA, DB fall on the circle ACB; let DCA cut the circle and DB fall on it; and let the rectangle AD, DC be equal to the square on DB.

I say that DB touches the circle ABC.

For let DE be drawn touching ABC; let the centre of the circle ABC be taken, and let it be F; let FE, FB, FD be joined.

Thus the angle FED is right. [III. 18]

Now, since DE touches the circle ABC, and DCA cuts it, the rectangle AD, DC is equal to the square on DE. [III. 36]

But the rectangle AD, DC was also equal to the square on DB; therefore the square on DE is equal to the square on DB;

therefore DE is equal to DB.
And FE is equal to FB; therefore the two sides DE, EF are equal to the two sides DB, BF; and FD is the common base of the triangles;

therefore the angle DEF is equal to the angle DBF. [I. 8]
But the angle DEF is right;

therefore the angle DBF is also right.
And FB produced is a diameter; and the straight line drawn at right angles to the diameter of a circle, from its extremity, touches the circle; [III. 16, Por.]

therefore DB touches the circle.
Similarly this can be proved to be the case even if the centre be on AC.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

1 12. For suppose it is not. This is expressed in the Greek by the two words Μὴ γάρ, but such an elliptical phrase is impossible in English.

2 the two sides AD, DG are equal to the two sides BD, DG respectively. As before observed, Euclid is not always careful to put the equals in corresponding order. The text here has “GD, DB.”

3 with the same construction, τῶν αὐτῶν κατασκευασθέντων.

4 of the same diameter. I have inserted these words for clearness' sake. The text has simply ἐλαχίστη δὲ ἡ λοιπή, “and the remaining (straight line) least.”

5 one on each side. The word “one” is not in the Greek, but is necessary to give the force of ἐφ̓ ἑκάτερα τῆς ἐλαχίστης, literally “on both sides,” or “on each of the two sides, of the least.”

6 The word circle (κύκλος) is here employed in the unusual sense of the circumference (περιφέρεια) of a circle. Cf. note on I. Def. 15.

7 the straight line joining their centres, literally “the straight line joined to their centres” (ἡ ἐπὶ τὰ κέντρα αὐτῶν ἐπιζευγνυμένη εὐθεῖα).

8 point of contact is here συναφἡ, and in the enunciation of the next proposition ἐπαφἡ.

9 will not fail to pass. The Greek has the double negative, οὐκ ἄρα ἡ...εὐθεῖα... οὐκ ἐλεύσεται, literally “the straight line...will not not-pass....”

10 ABDC. Euclid writes ABCD (here and in the next proposition), notwithstanding the order in which the points are placed in the figure.

11 does it so touch it. It is necessary to supply these words which the Greek (ὅτι οὐδὲ ἐκτός and ὅτι οὐδὲ ἐντός) leaves to be understood.

12 Of straight lines. The Greek leaves these words to be understood.

13 Nearer to the diameter AD. As BC, FG are not in general parallel to AD, Euclid should have said “nearer to the centre.”

16 the tangent, ἡ ἐφαπτομένη.

17 let another straight line be inflected, κεκλάσθω δὴ πάλιν (without εὐθεῖα). The verb κλάω (to break off) was the regular technical term for drawing from a point a (broken) straight line which first meets another straight line or curve and is then bent back from it to another point, or (in other words) for drawing straight lines from two points meeting at a point on a curve or another straight line. κεκλάσθαι is one of the geometrical terms the definition of which must according to Aristotle be assumed (Anal. Post. I. 10, 76 b 9).

18 cannot be constructed, οὐ συσταθήσεται, the same phrase as in 1. 7.

19 fall awry, παραλλάξει, the same word as used in the like case in I. 8. The word implies that the applied figure will partly fall short of, and partly overlap, the figure to which it is applied.

Into a given circle to fit a straight line equal to a given straight line which is not greater than the diameter of the circle.
Let ABC be the given circle, and D the given straight line not greater than the diameter of the circle; thus it is required to fit into the circle ABC a straight line equal to the straight line D.

Let a diameter BC of the circle ABC be drawn.

Then, if BC is equal to D, that which was enjoined will have been done; for BC has been fitted into the circle ABC equal to the straight line D.

But, if BC is greater than D, let CE be made equal to D, and with centre C and distance CE let the circle EAF be described; let CA be joined.

Then, since the point C is the centre of the circle EAF,

CA is equal to CE.
But CE is equal to D;

therefore D is also equal to CA.
Therefore into the given circle ABC there has been fitted CA equal to the given straight line D.

In a given circle to inscribe a triangle equiangular with a given triangle.
Let ABC be the given circle, and DEF the given triangle; thus it is required to inscribe in the circle ABC a triangle equiangular with the triangle DEF.

Let GH be drawn touching the circle ABC at A [III. 16, Por.]; on the straight line AH, and at the point A on it, let the angle HAC be constructed equal to the angle DEF, and on the straight line AG, and at the point A on it, let the angle GAB be constructed equal to the angle DFE; [I. 23] let BC be joined.

Then, since a straight line AH touches the circle ABC, and from the point of contact at A the straight line AC is drawn across in the circle, therefore the angle HAC is equal to the angle ABC in the alternate segment of the circle. [III. 32]

But the angle HAC is equal to the angle DEF; therefore the angle ABC is also equal to the angle DEF.

For the same reason

the angle ACB is also equal to the angle DFE;
therefore the remaining angle BAC is also equal to the remaining angle EDF. [I. 32]
Therefore in the given circle there has been inscribed a triangle equiangular with the given triangle. Q. E. F.

PROPOSITION 3.
About a given circle to circumscribe a triangle equiangular with a given triangle.
Let ABC be the given circle, and DEF the given triangle;
thus it is required to circumscribe about the circle ABC a triangle equiangular with the triangle DEF.

Let EF be produced in both directions to the points G, H, let the centre K of the circle ABC be taken [III. 1], and let
the straight line KB be drawn across at random; on the straight line KB, and at the point K on it, let the angle BKA be constructed equal to the angle DEG, and the angle BKC equal to the angle DFH; [I. 23] and through the points A, B, C let LAM, MBN, NCL be
drawn touching the circle ABC. [III. 16, Por.]

Now, since LM, MN, NL touch the circle ABC at the points A, B, C, and KA, KB, KC have been joined from the centre K to the points A, B, C,
therefore the angles at the points A, B, C are right. [III. 18]

And, since the four angles of the quadrilateral AMBK are equal to four right angles, inasmuch as AMBK is in fact divisible into two triangles,

and the angles KAM, KBM are right,

therefore the remaining angles AKB, AMB are equal to two right angles.
But the angles DEG, DEF are also equal to two right angles; [I. 13] therefore the angles AKB, AMB are equal to the angles
DEG, DEF, of which the angle AKB is equal to the angle DEG;

therefore the angle AMB which remains is equal to the angle DEF which remains.
Similarly it can be proved that the angle LNB is also
equal to the angle DFE;

therefore the remaining angle MLN is equal to the angle EDF. [I. 32]
Therefore the triangle LMN is equiangular with the triangle DEF; and it has been circumscribed about the
circle ABC.

Therefore about a given circle there has been circumscribed a triangle equiangular with the given triangle. Q. E. F. 1 2

PROPOSITION 4.
In a given triangle to inscribe a circle.
Let ABC be the given triangle; thus it is required to inscribe a circle in the triangle ABC.

Let the angles ABC, ACB
be bisected by the straight lines BD, CD [I. 9], and let these meet one another at the point D; from D let DE, DF, DG be drawn perpendicular to the straight
lines AB, BC, CA.

Now, since the angle ABD is equal to the angle CBD, and the right angle BED is also equal to the right angle BFD,
EBD, FBD are two triangles having two angles equal to two angles and one side equal to one side, namely that subtending one of the equal angles, which is BD common to the triangles;

therefore they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides; [I. 26]
therefore DE is equal to DF.
For the same reason

DG is also equal to DF.
Therefore the three straight lines DE, DF, DG are equal
to one another;

therefore the circle described with centre D and distance one of the straight lines DE, DF, DG will pass also through the remaining points, and will touch the straight lines AB, BC, CA, because the angles at the points E, F, G are right.
For, if it cuts them, the straight line drawn at right angles to the diameter of the circle from its extremity will be found to fall within the circle : which was proved absurd; [III. 16]

therefore the circle described with centre D and distance one of the straight lines DE, DF, DG will not cut the straight lines AB, BC, CA;
therefore it will touch them, and will be the circle inscribed in the triangle ABC. [IV. Def. 5]
Let it be inscribed, as FGE.

Therefore in the given triangle ABC the circle EFG has been inscribed. Q. E. F. 3

PROPOSITION 5.
About a given triangle to circumscribe a circle.
Let ABC be the given triangle; thus it is required to circumscribe a circle about the given triangle ABC.

Let the straight lines AB, AC be bisected at the points D, E [I. 10], and from the points D, E let DF, EF be drawn at right angles to AB, AC; they will then meet within the triangle ABC, or on the straight line BC, or outside BC.

First let them meet within at F, and let FB, FC, FA be joined.

Then, since AD is equal to DB, and DF is common and at right angles, therefore the base AF is equal to the base FB. [I. 4]

Similarly we can prove that

CF is also equal to AF;
so that FB is also equal to FC;
therefore the three straight lines FA, FB, FC are equal to one another.
Therefore the circle described with centre F and distance one of the straight lines FA, FB, FC will pass also through the remaining points, and the circle will have been circumscribed about the triangle ABC.

Let it be circumscribed, as ABC.

Next, let DF, EF meet on the straight line BC at F, as is the case in the second figure; and let AF be joined.

Then, similarly, we shall prove that the point F is the centre of the circle circumscribed about the triangle ABC.

Again, let DF, EF meet outside the triangle ABC at F, as is the case in the third figure, and let AF, BF, CF be joined.

Then again, since AD is equal to DB, and DF is common and at right angles, therefore the base AF is equal to the base BF. [I. 4]

Similarly we can prove that

CF is also equal to AF;
so that BF is also equal to FC; therefore the circle described with centre F and distance one of the straight lines FA, FB, FC will pass also through the remaining points, and will have been circumscribed about the triangle ABC.
Therefore about the given triangle a circle has been circumscribed. Q. E. F.

And it is manifest that, when the centre of the circle falls within the triangle, the angle BAC, being in a segment greater than the semicircle, is less than a right angle; when the centre falls on the straight line BC, the angle BAC, being in a semicircle, is right; and when the centre of the circle falls outside the triangle, the angle BAC, being in a segment less than the semicircle, is greater than a right angle.

In a given circle to inscribe a square.
Let ABCD be the given circle; thus it is required to inscribe a square in the circle ABCD.

Let two diameters AC, BD of the circle ABCD be drawn at right angles to one another, and let AB, BC, CD, DA be joined.

Then, since BE is equal to ED, for E is the centre, and EA is common and at right angles, therefore the base AB is equal to the base AD. [I. 4]

For the same reason each of the straight lines BC, CD is also equal to each of the straight lines AB, AD;

therefore the quadrilateral ABCD is equilateral.
I say next that it is also right-angled.

For, since the straight line BD is a diameter of the circle ABCD, therefore BAD is a semicircle;

therefore the angle BAD is right. [III. 31]
For the same reason each of the angles ABC, BCD, CDA is also right;

therefore the quadrilateral ABCD is right-angled.
But it was also proved equilateral; therefore it is a square; [I. Def. 22] and it has been inscribed in the circle ABCD.

Therefore in the given circle the square ABCD has been inscribed. Q. E. F.

PROPOSITION 7.
About a given circle to circumscribe a square.
Let ABCD be the given circle; thus it is required to circumscribe a square about the circle ABCD.

Let two diameters AC, BD of the circle ABCD be drawn at right angles to one another, and through the points A, B, C, D let FG, GH, HK, KF be drawn touching the circle ABCD. [III. 16, Por.]

Then, since FG touches the circle ABCD, and EA has been joined from the centre E to the point of contact at A,

therefore the angles at A are right. [III. 18]
For the same reason

the angles at the points B, C, D are also right.
Now, since the angle AEB is right, and the angle EBG is also right,

therefore GH is parailel to AC. [I. 28]
For the same reason

AC is also parallel to FK, so that GH is also parallel to FK. [I. 30]
Similarly we can prove that

each of the straight lines GF, HK is parallel to BED.
Therefore GK, GC, AK, FB, BK are parallelograms; therefore GF is equal to HK, and GH to FK. [I. 34]

And, since AC is equal to BD, and AC is also equal to each of the straight lines GH, FK,

while BD is equal to each of the straight lines GF, HK, [I. 34] therefore the quadrilateral FGHK is equilateral.
I say next that it is also right-angled.

For, since GBEA is a parallelogram, and the angle AEB is right, therefore the angle AGB is also right. [I. 34]

Similarly we can prove that

the angles at H, K, F are also right.
Therefore FGHK is right-angled.

But it was also proved equilateral;

therefore it is a square;
and it has been circumscribed about the circle ABCD.
Therefore about the given circle a square has been circumscribed. Q. E. F.

PROPOSITION 8.
In a given square to inscribe a circle.
Let ABCD be the given square; thus it is required to inscribe a circle in the given square ABCD.

Let the straight lines AD, AB be bisected at the points E, F respectively [I. 10], through E let EH be drawn parallel to either AB or CD, and through F let FK be drawn parallel to either AD or BC; [I. 31] therefore each of the figures AK, KB, AH, HD, AG, GC, BG, GD is a parallelogram, and their opposite sides are evidently equal. [I. 34]

Now, since AD is equal to AB, and AE is half of AD, and AF half of AB,

therefore AE is equal to AF, so that the opposite sides are also equal;
therefore FG is equal to GE.
Similarly we can prove that each of the straight lines GH, GK is equal to each of the straight lines FG, GE;

therefore the four straight lines GE, GF, GH, GK are equal to one another.
Therefore the circle described with centre G and distance one of the straight lines GE, GF, GH, GK will pass also through the remaining points.

And it will touch the straight lines AB, BC, CD, DA, because the angles at E, F, H, K are right.

For, if the circle cuts AB, BC, CD, DA, the straight line drawn at right angles to the diameter of the circle from its extremity will fall within the circle : which was proved absurd; [III. 16] therefore the circle described with centre G and distance one of the straight lines GE, GF, GH, GK will not cut the straight lines AB, BC, CD, DA.

Therefore it will touch them, and will have been inscribed in the square ABCD.

Therefore in the given square a circle has been inscribed. Q. E. F.

PROPOSITION 9.
About a given square to circumscribe a circle.
Let ABCD be the given square; thus it is required to circumscribe a circle about the square ABCD.

For let AC, BD be joined, and let them cut one another at E.

Then, since DA is equal to AB, and AC is common, therefore the two sides DA, AC are equal to the two sides BA, AC; and the base DC is equal to the base BC;

therefore the angle DAC is equal to the angle BAC. [I. 8]
Therefore the angle DAB is bisected by AC.

Similarly we can prove that each of the angles ABC, BCD, CDA is bisected by the straight lines AC, DB.

Now, since the angle DAB is equal to the angle ABC, and the angle EAB is half the angle DAB, and the angle EBA half the angle ABC, therefore the angle EAB is also equal to the angle EBA; so that the side EA is also equal to EB. [I. 6]

Similarly we can prove that each of the straight lines EA, EB is equal to each of the straight lines EC, ED.

Therefore the four straight lines EA, EB, EC, ED are equal to one another.

Therefore the circle described with centre E and distance one of the straight lines EA, EB, EC, ED will pass also through the remaining points; and it will have been circumscribed about the square ABCD.

Let it be circumscribed, as ABCD.

Therefore about the given square a circle has been circumscribed. Q. E. F.

PROPOSITION 10.
To construct an isosceles triangle having each of the angles at the base double of the remaining one.
Let any straight line AB be set out, and let it be cut at the point C so that the rectangle contained by AB, BC is equal to the square on CA; [II. 11] with centre A and distance AB let the circle BDE be described, and let there be fitted in the circle BDE the straight line BD equal to the straight line AC which is not greater than the diameter of the circle BDE. [IV. 1]

Let AD, DC be joined, and let the circle ACD be circumscribed about the triangle ACD. [IV. 5]

Then, since the rectangle AB, BC is equal to the square on AC, and AC is equal to BD, therefore the rectangle AB, BC is equal to the square on BD.

And, since a point B has been taken outside the circle ACD, and from B the two straight lines BA, BD have fallen on the circle ACD, and one of them cuts it, while the other falls on it, and the rectangle AB, BC is equal to the square on BD,

therefore BD touches the circle ACD. [III. 37]
Since, then, BD touches it, and DC is drawn across from the point of contact at D, therefore the angle BDC is equal to the angle DAC in the alternate segment of the circle. [III. 32]

Since, then, the angle BDC is equal to the angle DAC, let the angle CDA be added to each; therefore the whole angle BDA is equal to the two angles CDA, DAC.

But the exterior angle BCD is equal to the angles CDA, DAC; [I. 32] therefore the angle BDA is also equal to the angle BCD.

But the angle BDA is equal to the angle CBD, since the side AD is also equal to AB; [I. 5] so that the angle DBA is also equal to the angle BCD.

Therefore the three angles BDA, DBA, BCD are equal to one another.

And, since the angle DBC is equal to the angle BCD,

the side BD is also equal to the side DC. [I. 6]
But BD is by hypothesis equal to CA; therefore CA is also equal to CD,

so that the angle CDA is also equal to the angle DAC; [I. 5]
therefore the angles CDA, DAC are double of the angle DAC.
But the angle BCD is equal to the angles CDA, DAC; therefore the angle BCD is also double of the angle CAD.

But the angle BCD is equal to each of the angles BDA, DBA; therefore each of the angles BDA, DBA is also double of the angle DAB.

Therefore the isosceles triangle ABD has been constructed having each of the angles at the base DB double of the remaining one. Q. E. F.

PROPOSITION 11.
In a given circle to inscribe an equilateral and equiangular pentagon.
Let ABCDE be the given circle; thus it is required to inscribe in the circle ABCDE an equilateral and equiangular pentagon.

Let the isosceles triangle FGH be set out having each of the angles at G, H double of the angle at F; [IV. 10] let there be inscribed in the circle ABCDE the triangle ACD equiangular with the triangle FGH, so that the angle CAD is equal to the angle at F and the angles at G, H respectively equal to the angles ACD, CDA; [IV. 2] therefore each of the angles ACD, CDA is also double of the angle CAD.

Now let the angles ACD, CDA be bisected respectively by the straight lines CE, DB [I. 9], and let AB, BC, DE, EA be joined.

Then, since each of the angles ACD, CDA is double of the angle CAD, and they have been bisected by the straight lines CE, DB, therefore the five angles DAC, ACE, ECD, CDB, BDA are equal to one another.

But equal angles stand on equal circumferences; [III. 26] therefore the five circumferences AB, BC, CD, DE, EA are equal to one another.

But equal circumferences are subtended by equal straight lines; [III. 29] therefore the five straight lines AB, BC, CD, DE, EA are equal to one another;

therefore the pentagon ABCDE is equilateral.
I say next that it is also equiangular.

For, since the circumference AB is equal to the circumference DE, let BCD be added to each;

therefore the whole circumference ABCD is equal to the whole circumference EDCB.
And the angle AED stands on the circumference ABCD, and the angle BAE on the circumference EDCB;

therefore the angle BAE is also equal to the angle AED. [III. 27]
For the same reason each of the angles ABC, BCD, CDE is also equal to each of the angles BAE, AED;

therefore the pentagon ABCDE is equiangular.
But it was also proved equilateral;

therefore in the given circle an equilateral and equiangular pentagon has been inscribed. Q. E. F.
PROPOSITION 12.
About a given circle to circumscribe an equilateral and equiangular pentagon.
Let ABCDE be the given circle; thus it is required to circumscribe an equilateral and equiangular pentagon about the circle ABCDE.

Let A, B, C, D, E be conceived to be the angular points of the inscribed pentagon, so that the circumferences AB, BC, CD, DE, EA are equal; [IV. 11] through A, B, C, D, E let GH, HK, KL, LM, MG be drawn touching the circle; [III. 16, Por.] let the centre F of the circle ABCDE be taken [III. 1], and let FB, FK, FC, FL, FD be joined.

Then, since the straight line KL touches the circle ABCDE at C, and FC has been joined from the centre F to the point of contact at C,

therefore FC is perpendicular to KL; [III. 18] therefore each of the angles at C is right.
For the same reason

the angles at the points B, D are also right.
And, since the angle FCK is right, therefore the square on FK is equal to the squares on FC, CK.

For the same reason [I. 47]

the square on FK is also equal to the squares on FB, BK; so that the squares on FC, CK are equal to the squares on FB, BK, of which the square on FC is equal to the square on FB;
therefore the square on CK which remains is equal to the square on BK.
Therefore BK is equal to CK.

And, since FB is equal to FC, and FK common,

the two sides BF, FK are equal to the two sides CF, FK; and the base BK equal to the base CK; therefore the angle BFK is equal to the angle KFC, [I. 8] and the angle BKF to the angle FKC.
Therefore the angle BFC is double of the angle KFC,
and the angle BKC of the angle FKC.
For the same reason

the angle CFD is also double of the angle CFL, and the angle DLC of the angle FLC.
Now, since the circumference BC is equal to CD, the angle BFC is also equal to the angle CFD. [III. 27]

And the angle BFC is double of the angle KFC, and the angle DFC of the angle LFC;

therefore the angle KFC is also equal to the angle LFC.
But the angle FCK is also equal to the angle FCL; therefore FKC, FLC are two triangles having two angles equal to two angles and one side equal to one side, namely FC which is common to them; therefore they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides, and the remaining angle to the remaining angle; [I. 26]

therefore the straight line KC is equal to CL, and the angle FKC to the angle FLC.
And, since KC is equal to CL, therefore KL is double of KC.

For the same reason it can be proved that

HK is also double of BK.
And BK is equal to KC;

therefore HK is also equal to KL.
Similarly each of the straight lines HG, GM, ML can also be proved equal to each of the straight lines HK, KL;

therefore the pentagon GHKLM is equilateral.
I say next that it is also equiangular.

For, since the angle FKC is equal to the angle FLC, and the angle HKL was proved double of the angle FKC,

and the angle KLM double of the angle FLC, therefore the angle HKL is also equal to the angle KLM.
Similarly each of the angles KHG, HGM, GML can also be proved equal to each of the angles HKL, KLM; therefore the five angles GHK, HKL, KLM, LMG, MGH are equal to one another.

Therefore the pentagon GHKLM is equiangular.

And it was also proved equilateral; and it has been circumscribed about the circle ABCDE. Q. E. F.

PROPOSITION 13.
In a given pentagon, which is equilateral and equiangular, to inscribe a circle.
Let ABCDE be the given equilateral and equiangular pentagon; thus it is required to inscribe a circle in the pentagon ABCDE.

For let the angles BCD, CDE be bisected by the straight lines CF, DF respectively; and from the point F, at which the straight lines CF, DF meet one another, let the straight lines FB, FA, FE be joined.

Then, since BC is equal to CD, and CF common, the two sides BC, CF are equal to the two sides DC, CF; and the angle BCF is equal to the angle DCF;

therefore the base BF is equal to the base DF,
and the triangle BCF is equal to the triangle DCF, and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles, namely those which the equal sides subtend. [I. 4]
Therefore the angle CBF is equal to the angle CDF.

And, since the angle CDE is double of the angle CDF, and the angle CDE is equal to the angle ABC, while the angle CDF is equal to the angle CBF; therefore the angle CBA is also double of the angle CBF;

therefore the angle ABF is equal to the angle FBC;
therefore the angle ABC has been bisected by the straight line BF.
Similarly it can be proved that the angles BAE, AED have also been bisected by the straight lines FA, FE respectively.

Now let FG, FH, FK, FL, FM be drawn from the point F perpendicular to the straight lines AB, BC, CD, DE, EA.

Then, since the angle HCF is equal to the angle KCF, and the right angle FHC is also equal to the angle FKC, FHC, FKC are two triangles having two angles equal to two angles and one side equal to one side, namely FC which is common to them and subtends one of the equal angles; therefore they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides; [I. 26] therefore the perpendicular FH is equal to the perpendicular FK.

Similarly it can be proved that each of the straight lines FL, FM, FG is also equal to each of the straight lines FH, FK; therefore the five straight lines FG, FH, FK, FL, FM are equal to one another.

Therefore the circle described with centre F and distance one of the straight lines FG, FH, FK, FL, FM will pass also through the remaining points; and it will touch the straight lines AB, BC, CD, DE, EA, because the angles at the points G, H, K, L, M are right.

For, if it does not touch them. but cuts them, it will result that the straight line drawn at right angles to the diameter of the circle from its extremity falls within the circle: which was proved absurd. [III. 16]

Therefore the circle described with centre F and distance one of the straight lines FG, FH, FK, FL, FM will not cut the straight lines AB, BC, CD, DE, EA;

therefore it will touch them.
Let it be described, as GHKLM.

Therefore in the given pentagon, which is equilateral and equiangular, a circle has been inscribed. Q. E. F.

PROPOSITION 14.
About a given pentagon, which is equilateral and equiangular, to circumscribe a circle.
Let ABCDE be the given pentagon, which is equilateral and equiangular; thus it is required to circumscribe a circle about the pentagon ABCDE.

Let the angles BCD, CDE be bisected by the straight lines CF, DF respectively, and from the point F, at which the straight lines meet, let the straight lines FB, FA, FE be joined to the points B, A, E.

Then in manner similar to the preceding it can be proved that the angles CBA, BAE, AED have also been bisected by the straight lines FB, FA, FE respectively.

Now, since the angle BCD is equal to the angle CDE, and the angle FCD is half of the angle BCD, and the angle CDF half of the angle CDE, therefore the angle FCD is also equal to the angle CDF,

so that the side FC is also equal to the side FD. [I. 6]
Similarly it can be proved that each of the straight lines FB, FA, FE is also equal to each of the straight lines FC, FD; therefore the five straight lines FA, FB, FC, FD, FE are equal to one another.

Therefore the circle described with centre F and distance one of the straight lines FA, FB, FC, FD, FE will pass also through the remaining points, and will have been circumscribed.

Let it be circumscribed, and let it be ABCDE.

Therefore about the given pentagon, which is equilateral and equiangular, a circle has been circumscribed. Q. E. F.

PROPOSITION 15.
In a given circle to inscribe an equilateral and equiangular hexagon.
Let ABCDEF be the given circle; thus it is required to inscribe an equilateral and equiangular hexagon in the circle ABCDEF.

Let the diameter AD of the circle ABCDEF be drawn; let the centre G of the circle be taken, and with centre D and distance DG let the circle EGCH be described; let EG, CG be joined and carried through to the points B, F, and let AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA be joined.

I say that the hexagon ABCDEF is equilateral and equiangular.

For, since the point G is the centre of the circle ABCDEF,

GE is equal to GD.
Again, since the point D is the centre of the circle GCH,

DE is equal to DG.
But GE was proved equal to GD;

therefore GE is also equal to ED; therefore the triangle EGD is equilateral;
and therefore its three angles EGD, GDE, DEG are equal to one another, inasmuch as, in isosceles triangles, the angles at the base are equal to one another. [I. 5]
And the three angles of the triangle are equal to two right angles; [I. 32]

therefore the angle EGD is one-third of two right angles.
Similarly, the angle DGC can also be proved to be onethird of two right angles.

And, since the straight line CG standing on EB makes the adjacent angles EGC, CGB equal to two right angles, therefore the remaining angle CGB is also one-third of two right angles.

Therefore the angles EGD, DGC, CGB are equal to one another; so that the angles vertical to them, the angles BGA, AGF, FGE are equal. [I. 15]

Therefore the six angles EGD, DGC, CGB, BGA, AGF, FGE are equal to one another.

But equal angles stand on equal circumferences; [III. 26] therefore the six circumferences AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA are equal to one another.

And equal circumferences are subtended by equal straight lines; [III. 29]

therefore the six straight lines are equal to one another; therefore the hexagon ABCDEF is equilateral.
I say next that it is also equiangular.

For, since the circumference FA is equal to the circumference ED,

let the circumference ABCD be added to each; therefore the whole FABCD is equal to the whole EDCBA;
and the angle FED stands on the circumference FABCD, and the angle AFE on the circumference EDCBA;
therefore the angle AFE is equal to the angle DEF. [III. 27]
Similarly it can be proved that the remaining angles of the hexagon ABCDEF are also severally equal to each of the angles AFE, FED;

therefore the hexagon ABCDEF is equiangular.
But it was also proved equilateral; and it has been inscribed in the circle ABCDEF.

Therefore in the given circle an equilateral and equiangular hexagon has been inscribed. Q. E. F.

PORISM.
From this it is manifest that the side of the hexagon is equal to the radius of the circle.
And, in like manner as in the case of the pentagon, if through the points of division on the circle we draw tangents to the circle, there will be circumscribed about the circle an equilateral and equiangular hexagon in conformity with what was explained in the case of the pentagon.

And further by means similar to those explained in the case of the pentagon we can both inscribe a circle in a given hexagon and circumscribe one about it. Q. E. F.

PROPOSITION 16.
In a given circle to inscribe a fifteen-angled figure which shall be both equilateral and equiangular.
Let ABCD be the given circle; thus it is required to inscribe in the circle ABCD a fifteenangled figure which shall be both equilateral and equiangular.

In the circle ABCD let there be inscribed a side AC of the equilateral triangle inscribed in it, and a side AB of an equilateral pentagon; therefore, of the equal segments of which there are fifteen in the circle ABCD, there will be five in the circumference ABC which is one-third of the circle, and there will be three in the circumference AB which is one-fifth of the circle;

therefore in the remainder BC there will be two of the equal segments.
Let BC be bisected at E; [III. 30] therefore each of the circumferences BE, EC is a fifteenth of the circle ABCD.

If therefore we join BE, EC and fit into the circle ABCD straight lines equal to them and in contiguity, a fifteen-angled figure which is both equilateral and equiangular will have been inscribed in it. Q. E. F.

And, in like manner as in the case of the pentagon, if through the points of division on the circle we draw tangents to the circle, there will be circumscribed about the circle a fifteen-angled figure which is equilateral and equiangular.

And further, by proofs similar to those in the case of the pentagon, we can both inscribe a circle in the given fifteenangled figure and circumscribe one about it. Q. E. F.

PROPOSITION I.
If there be any number of magnitudes whatever which are, respectively, equimultiples of any magnitudes equal in multitude, then, whatever multiple one of the magnitudes is of one, that multiple also will all be of all.
Let any number of magnitudes whatever AB, CD be respectively equimultiples of any magnitudes E, F equal in multitude; I say that, whatever multiple AB is of E, that multiple will AB, CD also be of E, F.

For, since AB is the same multiple of E that CD is of F, as many magnitudes as there are in AB equal to E, so many also are there in CD equal to F.

Let AB be divided into the magnitudes AG, GB equal to E, and CD into CH, HD equal to F; then the multitude of the magnitudes AG, GB will be equal to the multitude of the magnitudes CH, HD.

Now, since AG is equal to E, and CH to F, therefore AG is equal to E, and AG, CH to E, F.

For the same reason

GB is equal to E, and GB, HD to E, F; therefore, as many magnitudes as there are in AB equal to E, so many also are there in AB, CD equal to E, F; therefore, whatever multiple AB is of E, that multiple will AB, CD also be of E, F.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

PROPOSITION 2.
If a first magnitude be the same multiple of a second that a third is of a fourth, and a fifth also be the same multiple of the second that a sixth is of the fourth, the sum of the first and fifth will also be the same multiple of the second that the sum of the third and sixth is of the fourth.
Let a first magnitude, AB, be the same multiple of a second, C, that a third, DE, is of a fourth, F, and let a fifth, BG, also be the same multiple of the second, C, that a sixth, EH, is of the fourth F; I say that the sum of the first and fifth, AG, will be the same multiple of the second, C, that the sum of the third and sixth, DH, is of the fourth, F.

For, since AB is the same multiple of C that DE is of F, therefore, as many magnitudes as there are in AB equal to C, so many also are there in DE equal to F.

For the same reason also, as many as there are in BG equal to C, so many are there also in EH equal to F; therefore, as many as there are in the whole AG equal to C, so many also are there in the whole DH equal to F.

Therefore, whatever multiple AG is of C, that multiple also is DH of F.

Therefore the sum of the first and fifth, AG, is the same multiple of the second, C, that the sum of the third and sixth, DH, is of the fourth, F.

Therefore etc. Q.E.D.

PROPOSITION 3.
If a first magnitude be the same multiple of a second that a third is of a fourth, and if equimultiples be taken of the first and third, then also ex aequali the magnitudes taken will be equimultiples respectively, the one of the second and the other of the fourth.
Let a first magnitude A be the same multiple of a second B that a third C is of a fourth D, and let equimultiples EF, GH be taken of A, C; I say that EF is the same multiple of B that GH is of D.

For, since EF is the same multiple of A that GH is of C, therefore, as many magnitudes as there are in EF equal to A, so many also are there in GH equal to C.

Let EF be divided into the magnitudes EK, KF equal to A, and GH into the magnitudes GL, LH equal to C; then the multitude of the magnitudes EK, KF will be equal to the multitude of the magnitudes GL, LH.

And, since A is the same multiple of B that C is of D, while EK is equal to A, and GL to C, therefore EK is the same multiple of B that GL is of D.

For the same reason

KF is the same multiple of B that LH is of D.

Since, then, a first magnitude EK is the same multiple of a second B that a third GL is of a fourth D, and a fifth KF is also the same multiple of the second B that a sixth LH is of the fourth D, therefore the sum of the first and fifth, EF, is also the same multiple of the second B that the sum of the third and sixth, GH, is of the fourth D. [V. 2]

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

PROPOSITION 4.
If a first magnitude have to a second the same ratio as a third to a fourth, any equimultiples whatever of the first and third will also have the same ratio to any equimultiples whatever of the second and fourth respectively, taken in corresponding order.
For let a first magnitude A have to a second B the same ratio as a third C to a fourth D; and let equimultiples E, F be taken of A, C, and G, H other, chance, equimultiples of B, D; I say that, as E is to G, so is F to H.

For let equimultiples K, L be taken of E, F, and other, chance, equimultiples M, N of G, H.

Since E is the same multiple of A that F is of C, and equimultiples K, L of E, F have been taken, therefore K is the same multiple of A that L is of C. [V. 3]

For the same reason

M is the same multiple of B that N is of D.
And, since, as A is to B, so is C to D, and of A, C equimultiples K, L have been taken, and of B, D other, chance, equimultiples M, N, therefore, if K is in excess of M, L also is in excess of N, if it is equal, equal, and if less, less. [V. Def. 5]

And K, L are equimultiples of E, F, and M, N other, chance, equimultiples of G, H; therefore, as E is to G, so is F to H. [V. Def. 5]

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

PROPOSITION 5.
If a magnitude be the same multiple of a magnitude that a part subtracted is of a part subtracted, the remainder will also be the same multiple of the remainder that the whole is of the whole.
For let the magnitude AB be the same multiple of the magnitude CD that the part AE subtracted is of the part CF subtracted; I say that the remainder EB is also the same multiple of the remainder FD that the whole AB is of the whole CD.

For, whatever multiple AE is of CF, let EB be made that multiple of CG.

Then, since AE is the same multiple of CF that EB is of GC, therefore AE is the same multiple of CF that AB is of GF. [V. 1]

But, by the assumption, AE is the same multiple of CF that AB is of CD.

Therefore AB is the same multiple of each of the magnitudes GF, CD;

therefore GF is equal to CD.

Let CF be subtracted from each; therefore the remainder GC is equal to the remainder FD.

And, since AE is the same multiple of CF that EB is of GC, and GC is equal to DF,
therefore AE is the same multiple of CF that EB is of FD.

But, by hypothesis,

AE is the same multiple of CF that AB is of CD; therefore EB is the same multiple of FD that AB is of CD.

That is, the remainder EB will be the same multiple of
the remainder FD that the whole AB is of the whole CD.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D. 1

If two magnitudes be equimultiples of two magnitudes, and any magnitudes subtracted from them be equimultiples of the same, the remainders also are either equal to the same or equimultiples of them.
For let two magnitudes AB, CD be equimultiples of two magnitudes E, F, and let AG, CH subtracted from them be equimultiples of the same two E, F; I say that the remainders also, GB, HD, are either equal to E, F or equimultiples of them.

For, first, let GB be equal to E; I say that HD is also equal to F.

For let CK be made equal to F.

Since AG is the same multiple of E that CH is of F, while GB is equal to E and KC to F, therefore AB is the same multiple of E that KH is of F. [V. 2]

But, by hypothesis, AB is the same multiple of E that CD is of F; therefore KH is the same multiple of F that CD is of F.

Since then each of the magnitudes KH, CD is the same multiple of F,

therefore KH is equal to CD.
Let CH be subtracted from each; therefore the remainder KC is equal to the remainder HD.

But F is equal to KC; therefore HD is also equal to F.

Hence, if GB is equal to E, HD is also equal to F.

Similarly we can prove that, even if GB be a multiple of E, HD is also the same multiple of F.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

Equal magnitudes have to the same the same ratio, as also has the same to equal magnitudes.
Let A, B be equal magnitudes and C any other, chance, magnitude; I say that each of the magnitudes A, B has the same ratio to C, and C has the same ratio to each of the magnitudes A, B.

For let equimultiples D, E of A, B be taken, and of C another, chance, multiple F.

Then, since D is the same multiple of A that E is of B, while A is equal to B,

therefore D is equal to E.
But F is another, chance, magnitude.

If therefore D is in excess of F, E is also in excess of F, if equal to it, equal; and, if less, less.

And D, E are equimultiples of A, B, while F is another, chance, multiple of C;

therefore, as A is to C, so is B to C. [V. Def. 5]
I say next that C also has the same ratio to each of the magnitudes A, B.

For, with the same construction, we can prove similarly that D is equal to E; and F is some other magnitude.

If therefore F is in excess of D, it is also in excess of E, if equal, equal; and, if less, less.

And F is a multiple of C, while D, E are other, chance, equimultiples of A, B;

therefore, as C is to A, so is C to B. [V. Def. 5]

PROPOSITION 8.
Of unequal magnitudes, the greater has to the same a greater ratio than the less has; and the same has to the less a greater ratio than it has to the greater.
Let AB, C be unequal magnitudes, and let AB be greater; let D be another, chance, magnitude; I say that AB has to D a greater ratio than C has to D, and D has to C a greater ratio than it has to AB.

For, since AB is greater than C, let BE be made equal to C; then the less of the magnitudes AE, EB, if multiplied, will sometime be greater than D. [V. Def. 4]

[Case I.]

First, let AE be less than EB; let AE be multiplied, and let FG be a multiple of it which is greater than D; then, whatever multiple FG is of AE, let GH be made the same multiple of EB and K of C; and let L be taken double of D, M triple of it, and successive multiples increasing by one, until what is taken is a multiple of D and the first that is greater than K. Let it be taken, and let it be N which is quadruple of D and the first multiple of it that is greather than K.

Then, since K is less than N first, therefore K is not less than M.

And, since FG is the same multiple of AE that GH is of EB, therefore FG is the same multiple of AE that FH is of AB. [V. 1]

But FG is the same multiple of AE that K is of C;

therefore FH is the same multiple of AB that K is of C; therefore FH, K are equimultiples of AB, C.
Again, since GH is the same multiple of EB that K is of C, and EB is equal to C,

therefore GH is equal to K.
But K is not less than M;

therefore neither is GH less than M.
And FG is greater than D; therefore the whole FH is greater than D, M together.

But D, M together are equal to N, inasmuch as M is triple of D, and M, D together are quadruple of D, while N is also quadruple of D; whence M, D together are equal to N.

But FH is greater than M, D;

therefore FH is in excess of N,
while K is not in excess of N.
And FH, K are equimultiples of AB, C, while N is another, chance, multiple of D;

therefore AB has to D a greater ratio than C has to D. [V. Def. 7]
I say next, that D also has to C a greater ratio than D has to AB.

For, with the same construction, we can prove similarly that N is in excess of K, while N is not in excess of FH.

And N is a multiple of D, while FH, K are other, chance, equimultiples of AB, C;

therefore D has to C a greater ratio than D has to AB. [V. Def. 7]
[Case 2.]

Again, let AE be greater than EB.

Then the less, EB, if multiplied, will sometime be greater than D. [V. Def. 4]

Let it be multiplied, and let GH be a multiple of EB and greater than D; and, whatever multiple GH is of EB, let FG be made the same multiple of AE, and K of C.

Then we can prove similarly that FH, K are equimultiples of AB, C; and, similarly, let N be taken a multiple of D but the first that is greater than FG, so that FG is again not less than M.

But GH is greater than D; therefore the whole FH is in excess of D, M, that is, of N.

Now K is not in excess of N, inasmuch as FG also, which is greater than GH, that is, than K, is not in excess of N.

And in the same manner, by following the above argument, we complete the demonstration.

Magnitudes which have the same ratio to the same are equal to one another; and magnitudes to which the same has the same ratio are equal.
For let each of the magnitudes A, B have the same ratio to C; I say that A is equal to B.

For, otherwise, each of the magnitudes A, B would not have had the same ratio to C; [V. 8] but it has;

therefore A is equal to B.
Again, let C have the same ratio to each of the magnitudes A, B; I say that A is equal to B.

For, otherwise, C would not have had the same ratio to each of the magnitudes A, B; [V. 8] but it has;

Of magnitudes which have a ratio to the same, that which has a greater ratio is greater; and that to which the same has a greater ratio is less.
For let A have to C a greater ratio than B has to C; I say that A is greater than B.

For, if not, A is either equal to B or less.

Now A is not equal to B; for in that case each of the magnitudes A, B would have had the same ratio to C; [V. 7] but they have not;

therefore A is not equal to B.
Nor again is A less than B; for in that case A would have had to C a less ratio than B has to C; [V. 8] but it has not;

therefore A is not less than B.
But it was proved not to be equal either;

therefore A is greater than B.
Again, let C have to B a greater ratio than C has to A; I say that B is less than A.

For, if not, it is either equal or greater.

Now B is not equal to A; for in that case C would have had the same ratio to each of the magnitudes A, B; [V. 7] but it has not;

therefore A is not equal to B.
Nor again is B greater than A; for in that case C would have had to B a less ratio than it has to A; [V. 8] but it has not;

therefore B is not greater than A.
But it was proved that it is not equal either;

therefore B is less than A.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

Ratios which are the same with the same ratio are also the same with one another.
For, as A is to B, so let C be to D, and, as C is to D, so let E be to F; I say that, as A is to B, so is E to F.

For of A, C, E let equimultiples G, H, K be taken, and of B, D, F other, chance, equimultiples L, M, N.

Then since, as A is to B, so is C to D, and of A, C equimultiples G, H have been taken, and of B, D other, chance, equimultiples L, M, therefore, if G is in excess of L, H is also in excess of M, if equal, equal, and if less, less.

Again, since, as C is to D, so is E to F, and of C, E equimultiples H, K have been taken, and of D, F other, chance, equimultiples M, N, therefore, if H is in excess of M, K is also in excess of N, if equal, equal, and if less, less.

But we saw that, if H was in excess of M, G was also in excess of L; if equal, equal; and if less, less; so that, in addition, if G is in excess of L, K is also in excess of N, if equal, equal, and if less, less.

And G, K are equimultiples of A, E, while L, N are other, chance, equimultiples of B, F;

therefore, as A is to B, so is E to F.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

If any number of magnitudes be proportional, as one of the antecedents is to one of the consequents, so will all the antecedents be to all the consequents.
Let any number of magnitudes A, B, C, D, E, F be proportional, so that, as A is to B, so is C to D and E to F; I say that, as A is to B, so are A, C, E to B, D, F.

For of A, C, E let equimultiples G, H, K be taken, and of B, D, F other, chance, equimultiples L, M, N.

Then since, as A is to B, so is C to D, and E to F, and of A, C, E equimultiples G, H, K have been taken, and of B, D, F other, chance, equimultiples L, M, N, therefore, if G is in excess of L, H is also in excess of M, and K of N, if equal, equal, and if less, less; so that, in addition, if G is in excess of L, then G, H, K are in excess of L, M, N, if equal, equal, and if less, less.

Now G and G, H, K are equimultiples of A and A, C, E, since, if any number of magnitudes whatever are respectively equimultiples of any magnitudes equal in multitude, whatever multiple one of the magnitudes is of one, that multiple also will all be of all. [V. 1]

For the same reason L and L, M, N are also equimultiples of B and B, D, F;

therefore, as A is to B, so are A, C, E to B, D, F. [V. Def. 5]

If a first magnitude have to a second the same ratio as a third to a fourth, and the third have to the fourth a greater ratio than a fifth has to a sixth, the first will also have to the second a greater ratio than the fifth to the sixth.
For let a first magnitude A have to a second B the same ratio as a third C has to a fourth D, and let the third C have to the fourth D a greater ratio than a fifth E has to a sixth F; I say that the first A will also have to the second B a greater ratio than the fifth E to the sixth F.

For, since there are some equimultiples of C, E, and of D, F other, chance, equimultiples, such that the multiple of C is in excess of the multiple of D, while the multiple of E is not in excess of the multiple of F, [V. Def. 7] let them be taken, and let G, H be equimultiples of C, E, and K, L other, chance, equimultiples of D, F, so that G is in excess of K, but H is not in excess of L; and, whatever multiple G is of C, let M be also that multiple of A, and, whatever multiple K is of D, let N be also that multiple of B.

Now, since, as A is to B, so is C to D, and of A, C equimultiples M, G have been taken, and of B, D other, chance, equimultiples N, K, therefore, if M is in excess of N, G is also in excess of K, if equal, equal, and if less, less. [V. Def. 5]

But G is in excess of K; therefore M is also in excess of N.

But H is not in excess of L; and M, H are equimultiples of A, E, and N, L other, chance, equimultiples of B, F;

therefore A has to B a greater ratio than E has to F. [V. Def. 7]

If a first magnitude have to a second the same ratio as a third has to a fourth, and the first be greater than the third, the second will also be greater than the fourth; if equal, equal; and if less, less.
For let a first magnitude A have the same ratio to a second B as a third C has to a fourth D; and let A be greater than C; I say that B is also greater than D.

For, since A is greater than C, and B is another, chance, magnitude, therefore A has to B a greater ratio than C has to B. [V. 8]

But, as A is to B, so is C to D;

therefore C has also to D a greater ratio than C has to B. [V. 13]
But that to which the same has a greater ratio is less; [V. 10]

therefore D is less than B; so that B is greater than D.
Similarly we can prove that, if A be equal to C, B will also be equal to D; and, if A be less than C, B will also be less than D.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

PROPOSITION 15.
Parts have the same ratio as the same multiples of them taken in corresponding order.
For let AB be the same multiple of C that DE is of F; I say that, as C is to F, so is AB to DE.

For, since AB is the same multiple of C that DE is of F, as many magnitudes as there are in AB equal to C, so many are there also in DE equal to F.

Let AB be divided into the magnitudes AG, GH, HB equal to C, and DE into the magnitudes DK, KL, LE equal to F; then the multitude of the magnitudes AG, GH, HB will be equal to the multitude of the magnitudes DK, KL, LE.

And, since AG. GH, HB are equal to one another, and DK, KL, LE are also equal to one another, therefore, as AG is to DK, so is GH to KL, and HB to LE. [V. 7]

Therefore, as one of the antecedents is to one of the consequents, so will all the antecedents be to all the consequents; [V. 12]

therefore, as AG is to DK, so is AB to DE.
But AG is equal to C and DK to F;

therefore, as C is to F, so is AB to DE.

If four magnitudes be proportional, they will also be proportional alternately.
Let A, B, C, D be four proportional magnitudes, so that, as A is to B, so is C to D; I say that they will also be so alternately, that is, as A is to C, so is B to D.

For of A, B let equimultiples E, F be taken, and of C, D other, chance, equimultiples G, H.

Then, since E is the same multiple of A that F is of B, and parts have the same ratio as the same multiples of them, [V. 15] therefore, as A is to B, so is E to F.

But as A is to B, so is C to D; therefore also, as C is to D, so is E to F. [V. 11]

Again, since G, H are equimultiples of C, D, therefore, as C is to D, so is G to H. [V. 15]

But, as C is to D, so is E to F; therefore also, as E is to F, so is G to H. [V. 11]

But, if four magnitudes be proportional, and the first be greater than the third,

the second will also be greater than the fourth;
if equal, equal; and if less, less. [V. 14]
Therefore, if E is in excess of G, F is also in excess of H, if equal, equal, and if less, less.

Now E, F are equimultiples of A, B, and G, H other, chance, equimultiples of C, D;

therefore, as A is to C, so is B to D. [V. Def. 5]

If magnitudes be proportional componendo, they will also be proportional separando.
Let AB, BE, CD, DF be magnitudes proportional componendo, so that, as AB is to BE, so is CD to DF; I say that they will also be proportional separando, that is, as AE is to EB, so is CF to DF.

For of AE, EB, CF, FD let equimultiples GH, HK, LM, MN be taken, and of EB, FD other, chance, equimultiples, KO, NP.

Then, since GH is the same multiple of AE that HK is of EB, therefore GH is the same multiple of AE that GK is of AB. [V. 1]

But GH is the same multiple of AE that LM is of CF; therefore GK is the same multiple of AB that LM is of CF.

Again, since LM is the same multiple of CF that MN is of FD, therefore LM is the same multiple of CF that LN is of CD. [V. 1]

But LM was the same multiple of CF that GK is of AB; therefore GK is the same multiple of AB that LN is of CD.

Therefore GK, LN are equimultiples of AB, CD.

Again, since HK is the same multiple of EB that MN is of FD,

and KO is also the same multiple of EB that NP is of FD, therefore the sum HO is also the same multiple of EB that MP is of FD. [V. 2]
And, since, as AB is to BE, so is CD to DF, and of AB, CD equimultiples GK, LN have been taken, and of EB, FD equimultiples HO, MP, therefore, if GK is in excess of HO, LN is also in excess of MP, if equal, equal, and if less, less.

Let GK be in excess of HO; then, if HK be subtracted from each,

GH is also in excess of KO.
But we saw that, if GK was in excess of HO, LN was also in excess of MP;

therefore LN is also in excess of MP,
and, if MN be subtracted from each,
LM is also in excess of NP;
so that, if GH is in excess of KO, LM is also in excess of NP.
Similarly we can prove that, if GH be equal to KO, LM will also be equal to NP, and if less, less.

And GH, LM are equimultiples of AE, CF, while KO, NP are other, chance, equimultiples of EB, FD;

therefore, as AE is to EB, so is CF to FD.

Let AE, EB, CF, FD be magnitudes proportional separando, so that, as AE is to EB, so is CF to FD; I say that they will also be proportional componendo, that is, as AB is to BE, so is CD to FD.

For, if CD be not to DF as AB to BE, then, as AB is to BE, so will CD be either to some magnitude less than DF or to a greater.

First, let it be in that ratio to a less magnitude DG.

Then, since, as AB is to BE, so is CD to DG, they are magnitudes proportional componendo;

so that they will also be proportional separando. [V. 17]
Therefore, as AE is to EB, so is CG to GD.

But also, by hypothesis,

as AE is to EB, so is CF to FD.
Therefore also, as CG is to GD, so is CF to FD. [V. 11]

But the first CG is greater than the third CF;

therefore the second GD is also greater than the fourth FD. [V. 14]
But it is also less: which is impossible.

Therefore, as AB is to BE, so is not CD to a less magnitude than FD.

Similarly we can prove that neither is it in that ratio to a greater;

it is therefore in that ratio to FD itself.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

If, as a whole is to a whole, so is a part subtracted to a part subtracted, the remainder will also be to the remainder as whole to whole.
For, as the whole AB is to the whole CD, so let the part AE subtracted be to the part CF subtracted; I say that the remainder EB will also be to the remainder FD as the whole AB to the whole CD.

For since, as AB is to CD, so is AE to CF, alternately also, as BA is to AE, so is DC to CF. [V. 16]

And, since the magnitudes are proportional componendo, they will also be proportional separando, [V. 17] that is, as BE is to EA, so is DF to CF, and, alternately,

as BE is to DF, so is EA to FC. [V. 16]
But, as AE is to CF, so by hypothesis is the whole AB to the whole CD.

Therefore also the remainder EB will be to the remainder FD as the whole AB is to the whole CD. [V. 11]

and as B is to C, so is E to F; and let A be greater than C ex aequali; I say that D will also be greater than F; if A is equal to C, equal; and, if less, less.
For, since A is greater than C, and B is some other magnitude, and the greater has to the same a greater ratio than the less has, [V. 8] therefore A has to B a greater ratio than C has to B.

But, as A is to B, so is D to E, and, as C is to B, inversely, so is F to E; therefore D has also to E a greater ratio than F has to E. [V. 13]

For, since A is greater than C, and B is some other magnitude, therefore A has to B a greater ratio than C has to B. [V. 8]

But, as A is to B, so is E to F, and, as C is to B, inversely, so is E to D. Therefore also E has to F a greater ratio than E has to D. [V. 13]

But that to which the same has a greater ratio is less; [V. 10]

For of A, D let equimultiples G, H be taken, and of B, E other, chance, equimultiples K, L; and, further, of C, F other, chance, equimultiples M, N.

Then, since, as A is to B, so is D to E, and of A, D equimultiples G, H have been taken, and of B, E other, chance, equimultiples K, L,

therefore, as G is to K, so is H to L. [V. 4]
For the same reason also,

as K is to M, so is L to N.
Since, then, there are three magnitudes G, K, M, and others H, L, N equal to them in multitude, which taken two and two together are in the same ratio, therefore, ex aequali, if G is in excess of M, H is also in excess of N; if equal, equal; and if less, less. [V. 20]

Of A, B, D let equimultiples G, H, K be taken, and of C, E, F other, chance, equimultiples L, M, N.

Then, since G, H are equimultiples of A, B, and parts have the same ratio as the same multiples of them, [V. 15]

therefore, as A is to B, so is G to H.
For the same reason also,

as E is to F, so is M to N.
And, as A is to B, so is E to F;

Next, since, as B is to C, so is D to E, alternately, also, as B is to D, so is C to E. [V. 16]

And, since H, K are equimultiples of B, D, and parts have the same ratio as their equimultiples,

therefore, as B is to D, so is H to K. [V. 15]
But, as B is to D, so is C to E;

therefore also, as H is to K, so is C to E. [V. 11]
Again, since L, M are equimultiples of C, E,

therefore, as C is to E, so is L to M. [V. 15]
But, as C is to E, so is H to K;

therefore also, as H is to K, so is L to M, [V. 11]
and, alternately, as H is to L, so is K to M. [V. 16]

as G is to H, so is M to N.
Since, then, there are three magnitudes G, H, L, and others equal to them in multitude K, M, N, which taken two and two together are in the same ratio, and the proportion of them is perturbed, therefore, ex aequali, if G is in excess of L, K is also in excess of N; if equal, equal; and if less, less.

And, since AG is equal to E, and CH to F, therefore AG, F are equal to CH, E.

And if, GB, HD being unequal, and GB greater, AG, F be added to GB and CH, E be added to HD,

it follows that AB, F are greater than CD, E.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

1 let EB be made that multiple of CG, τοσαυταπλάσιον γεγονέτω καὶ τὸ ΕΒ τοῦ ΓΗ. From this way of stating the construction one might suppose that CG was given and EB had to be found equal to a certain multiple of it. But in fact EB is what is given and CG has to be found, i.e. CG has to be constructed as a certain submultiple of EB.

2 “Let A, B, C, D be four proportional magnitudes, so that, as A is to B, so is C to D.” In a number of expressions like this it is absolutely necessary, when translating into English, to interpolate words which are not in the Greek. Thus the Greek here is: Ἕστω τέσσαρα μεγέθη ἀνάλογον τὰ Α, Β, Γ, Δ, ὡς τὸ Α πρὸς τὸ Β, οὕτως τὸ Γ πρὸς τὸ Δ, literally “Let A, B, C, D be four proportional magnitudes, as A to B, so C to D.” The same remark applies to the corresponding expressions in the next propositions, V. 17, 18, and to other forms of expression in V. 20-23 and later propositions: e.g. in V. 20 we have a phrase meaning literally “Let there be magnitudes...which taken two and two are in the same ratio, as A to B, so D to E,” etc.: in V. 21 “(magnitudes)...which taken two and two are in the same ratio, and let the proportion of them be perturbed, as A to B, so E to F,” etc. In all such cases (where the Greek is so terse as to be almost ungrammatical) I shall insert the words necessary in English, without further remark.
